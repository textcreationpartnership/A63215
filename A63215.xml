            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, we do charge that this was a falſe Oath, and in a point expreſsly to the matter then in controverſie before that Court; for we ſhall prove he was beyond Sea at that time, and on that day, and in order to his Conviction we ſhall make out by clear Evidence to you as full and plain as ever was given, that from <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> before, which was in <hi>December</hi> 1677. till Midſummer after, which was the latter end of <hi>June</hi> 1678. <hi>Oates</hi> that ſwears this Conſult in <hi>April,</hi> was at St. <hi>Omers,</hi> and in all that time was not abſent from the Colledge there above 24 Hours, and that but once only, which was in <hi>January</hi> when he played Truant, and went to <hi>Watton,</hi> which is about two Miles from St. <hi>Omers,</hi> but otherwiſe he was all along in the Colledge. And my Lord, that we may give ſuch a ſatisfactary Evidence as may make it undeniably plain to the Jury, I deſire your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and you Gentlemen of the Jury would pleaſe to obſerve ſome particular Periods of time, that I ſhall open for the better clearing our Evidence Methodically; and the firſt Period of time is from Mr. <hi>Hilſley</hi>'s leaving St. <hi>Omers;</hi> now he left St. <hi>Omers</hi> the fourteenth of <hi>April</hi> Old ſtile, which is the <hi>24th.</hi> of <hi>April</hi> New ſtile, and then when he came away, he left <hi>Oates</hi> there at St. <hi>Omers;</hi> Mr. <hi>Hilſley,</hi> when he came into <hi>England,</hi> in <hi>Kent</hi> in his Journey to <hi>London,</hi> meets one Mr. <hi>Burnaby;</hi> this was I ſay in Mr. <hi>Hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleys</hi> Return to <hi>England</hi> from St. <hi>Omers,</hi> which he left ten days before the time aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by <hi>Oates</hi> for this Conſult, at the <hi>White Horſe</hi> Tavern in the <hi>Strand,</hi> and the next Period is, Mr. <hi>Burnaby</hi> wa going to <hi>St. Omers,</hi> and there he arrives in time the 21. of <hi>April,</hi> old ſtile, and there he sfinds Mr. <hi>Oates,</hi> who ſwore he was then in <hi>London;</hi> and by the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence you will hear that Mr. <hi>Oates,</hi> according to his uſual cuſtome, and according to

For my Lord, we ſhall, beſides theſe particular times of theſe Gentlemens coming over, who left him there, prove the very day when he left St. <hi>Omers,</hi> and that was the end of <hi>Midſummer</hi> day following, which was the <hi>23d.</hi> of <hi>June;</hi> then was the time when <hi>Oates</hi> came firſt from St. <hi>Omers</hi> to <hi>England,</hi> and we ſhall prove he took his leave of them then. My Lord, we have many other Circumſtances that will unanſwerably ſtrengthen this Evidence, and ſhow that our Witneſſes teſtifie nothing but the Truth; one particularly is this; this Gentleman being a Novice of the Houſe, was Reader in the <hi>Sodality,</hi> as they call it, we ſhall prove that for every <hi>Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> and <hi>Holy-Day</hi> throughout all <hi>April</hi> and <hi>May,</hi> he did officiate in that place, and did read to the Society according as the Cuſtom there is; and we ſhall prove another par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular thing, that upon this <hi>24th.</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> he was in the Colledge, by a particular cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, and that by ſeveral Witneſſes; ſo that Gentlemen, not to detain you with any long opening of the matter, if we prove this that I have opened, as we ſhall with a Cloud of Witneſſes, it will make an end of the Queſtion. We ſhall firſt, call our Witneſſes to prove that he ſwore at that Tryal, that ſuch a Conſult was, and he was at it, and then if we prove that he was at another place beyond Sea, at ſuch diſtance that it is impoſſible for him to be here; I do not doubt but the Court and the Jury will conclude he hath willfully and corruptly forſwore himſelf; the ſaid effects of which we are all witneſſes of; it was to take away the Lives of his fellow Subjects wrongfully; and it will appear to the World he has been one of the greateſt Impoſtors that ever did appear upon the Stage, either in this Kingdom, or in any other Nation.</p>

               <p>Have you any more Queſtions to ask him?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Oates.</speaker>
               <p>I would ask him another Queſtion; whether I did ſwear, that I did carry this Reſolution from Chamber to Chamber to be ſigned, or that I carryed it from Chamber to Chamber and ſaw them ſign it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Foſter.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>You did ſwear, that you carryed the Reſolution from Chamber to Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and ſaw them ſign it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Oates.</speaker>
               <p>But did you remember it ſo particularly, as to ſay which you ſwore, whether I did carry it to be ſigned, or carryed it, and ſaw them ſign it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Foſter.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>You ſaid, you carryed it to be ſigned, and you ſaw it ſigned.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>He tells you for a ſatisfaction in that point, that he does remember you did ſwear it both ways.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Oates.</speaker>
               <p>He does ſay ſo indeed, but whether it was ſo or no is a doubt.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>That will be a Queſtion by and by it may be, if he be in the wrong, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe you can rectifie him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Oates.</speaker>
               <p>We are now my Lord upon my Oath, and therefore it concerns me to enquire whether I ſwore as is laid in the Indictment.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>You ſay right, it does ſo.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Oates.</speaker>
               <p>And I the rather ask theſe Queſtions my Lord, becauſe it is ſix years ago ſince that Tryal.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J,</speaker>
               <p>I hope you have not forgot what you ſwore, have you?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Oates.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I think it is fair for me to ask the Witneſſes what they remember after ſo long a time.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis very fair, no body ſays any thing to the contrary.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Oates.</speaker>
               <p>Then my Lord, I hope I may ask this Gentleman how he comes to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be all this after ſo long a time.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>He has told you already, but tell it him again Mr. <hi>Foſter.</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Foſter.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>Truly it is ſo long ago, that had I not taken all theſe Notes at the Tryal I had not been able to have given ſo good an account.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis a very good reaſon.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Oates.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis ſo my Lord, I have ſubpoena'd others of the Jury, and they will, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, give you as good an account.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Have you done with him then.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Oates.</speaker>
               <p>I have one Queſtion more to ask Mr. <hi>Foſter,</hi> and that is, whether I ſwore they met all in one Room, at the <hi>White Horſe</hi> Tavern, or in more than one.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Foſter.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>You ſwore they were in ſeveral Rooms.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Oates.</speaker>
               <p>Then I would ask him this Queſtion my Lord, whether he were then ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that <hi>Ireland</hi> was guilty of the High Treaſon he was then indicted.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>The meaning of the Queſtion is, I ſuppoſe, whether you did believe Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> at that time.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Foſter.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>Yes, my Lord I had no reaſon to the contrary.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>But I would ask you a Queſtion then Mr. <hi>Foſter.</hi> Do you believe him now? Do you think Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> he would have found him guilty, if he had not beleived the Evidence againſt him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Oates.</speaker>
               <p>We know how Juries have gone alate.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Ay, very ſtrangely indeed Mr. <hi>Oates,</hi> and I hope ſo as we ſhall never ſee them go again.</p>

               <p>I care not what you look upon your ſelf to be, if you will ask Queſtions, ask none but fair Queſtions, and while you keep within Bounds, you ſhall be heard as well as any of the Kings Subjects; but if you will break out into Queſtions that are imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, extravagant, or enſnaring, we muſt correct you, and keep you within proper Limits.</p>

               <p>Then my Lord, I ask whether he was not a Witneſs at the Tryal of the Five Jeſuites, and at <hi>Langhorn</hi>'s Tryal.</p>

            <sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Oates.</speaker>
               <p>Pray my Lord, ask him what Credit he received at thoſe Tryals.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Oates.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I think it is a fair Queſtion.</p>

               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>No indeed, it is not a fair one at all.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Oates.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I deſire to know what induces him to come here as a Witneſs now,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:102575:9"/>ſince it appears that now he comes to give an Evidence that he gave ſix years ago, and was not believed.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Hilſley.</hi>

               <p>He has given you an anſwer to the Queſtion, though I think it was an idle Queſtion, and not at all to the purpoſe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Oates.</speaker>

               </speaker>
               <p>Well, he tells you he came, becauſe he was ſubpoena'd, and that is ſufficient: He is not compellable to be a Witneſs, unleſs he be ſubpoena'd; but if a man will come without a Subpoena, and give Evidence in a Cauſe; that is no objection to his teſtimony.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Oates.</speaker>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Oates.</speaker>
               <p>Then my Lord, I would ask him this queſtion, why he is ſo preciſe as to his Remembrance of what was done in <hi>April</hi> and <hi>May,</hi> when he does not give any account of any other time, nor did the other Witneſſes.</p>

            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>If you will, I'll ask him that queſtion again for your ſatisfaction.</p>

               <speaker>Oates.</speaker>

               <p>He was not abſent above one night in <hi>January</hi> that I can remember from his firſt coming thither, for it was impoſſible he ſhould be abſent and not miſs'd, he ſitting at a diſtinct Table by himſelf, and his Converſation being ſo remarkable for a great many ridiculous actions, and a great many pretty jeſts that he us'd, ſo that he was like a ſilly perſon, as I may call him, that us'd to make ſport, and no body could be miſs'd ſo ſoon as he: And I ſaw a little Boy in the Colledge beat him up and down with a Foxes Tail. Indeed, my Lord, all his actions were very remarkable: I ſee him very much abuſive to perſons that liv'd with him in the Colledge; and Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> could not be a perſon of this note, but all the world muſt take notice of him, and all that knew him muſt miſs him, if he were away.</p>

               <p>Yes, I was: I came the <hi>10th</hi> of <hi>December</hi> 77 to St. <hi>Omers,</hi> he told me he came thither that day too, and I liv'd there all the time that he was there, which was till towards the middle of Summer: I do not remember that he ever was abſent, but once at <hi>Watton.</hi>

               <p>There came a Gentleman there that deſir'd a Charity of the Students, and I was the perſon that made the collection for him in the houſe; and I remember he did ask if there was any one that was a Student there that had been in <hi>Spain:</hi> We told him there was one, and deſcrib'd him, upon which he knew the Gentleman in <hi>Spain;</hi> upon that I told Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> that there was one there that knew him, but he deny'd to come and ſpeak with him. Now I remember that it was the time of the Congregation, for ſome enquiry made why he got ſo little money at <hi>Watton,</hi> and it was ſaid it was becauſe the Fathers were gone to the Congregation in <hi>England:</hi> And he ask'd me particularly, What was done at the Congregation in <hi>England?</hi>

               <p>My Lord, Here is an Indictment brought againſt me for Perjury; and this Indictment ſets forth, <hi>That I ſhould upon the</hi> 17th. <hi>of</hi> December <hi>appear at the</hi> Old-Bailey, <hi>and there ſwear, That there was a Treaſonable Conſult of the</hi> Jeſuits <hi>met at the</hi> White-horſe-Tavern <hi>in the</hi> Strand, <hi>and that this Treaſonable Conſult did divide it ſelf into leſſer Companies and Meetings, and that I carried about a certain Reſolution, which the</hi> Jeſuits <hi>came to, concerning killing the King, from Chamber to Chamber to be ſign'd.</hi> My Lord, I have a great exception to make to this Indictment, and that is, my Lord, as to the form<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For, by your Lordſhips favour, I think the Perjury is not well aſſign'd, and according as I am adviſed I offer this to your Lordſhips conſideration. It ſays in the aſſignment of the Perjury, <hi>Ubi revera &amp; in facto praedictus</hi> Titus Otes <hi>non praeſens fuit ad aliquam Conſultationem Jeſuitarum apud le</hi> White-horſe-Tavern <hi>praedict in le</hi> Strand <hi>in Com</hi> Midd' <hi>praedict' ſuper viceſimum quartum diem</hi> April' <hi>anno Dom' Milliceſimo.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>No, it is true <hi>Latine</hi> there:</p>

            <sp>

               <speaker>Oates.</speaker>
               <p>It is written in ſuch a hand, I cannot read it; but the ſubſtance of it is, it ſays here, That I did not carry any Reſolution from Chamber to Chamber <hi>ſignand'.</hi> Now, the Evidence charged upon me to be given, is, That I did not ſee it <hi>ſignat':</hi> So that the aſſignment of the Perjury does not purſue the Oath as it is ſet forth; for if it be <hi>ſignat'</hi> in the Evidence that was given, it ought to be <hi>ſignat'</hi> in the Perjury that is aſſigned; and I humbly crave the Opinion of your Lordſhip and the Court upon this point.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Look you, Mr. <hi>Oates,</hi> That you offer'd before, and I gave this Anſwer, which I muſt now repeat, That now we are upon the Fact, and this exception will be ſav'd to you for its proper time, if you be convicted. It is not proper now; but ſuppoſe there were that thing which you ſay is an Objection, yet you muſt know that there are Two Perjuries that are aſſign'd; the One is upon the firſt part of your Oath, which was, That you were preſent at a Conſult of the Jeſuits the <hi>24th.</hi> of <hi>April</hi> 78. at the <hi>White-horſe-Tavern</hi> in the <hi>Strand, Ubi revera</hi> you were not there. Now, Do you admit in the firſt place, that you were forſworn in that particular.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Oates.</speaker>
               <p>No, my Lord, I do not.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>If the Jury find that you were forſworn in that firſt point, that you were not there, it will be eaſily believed you ſwore falſe in the other point, that you did not carry the Reſolution from Chamber to Chamber.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Oates.</speaker>
               <p>But, my Lord, it is not well aſſign'd, I think.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>That will be ſav'd to you after the Verdict, I tell you, if there be occaſion for it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Oates.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I ſuppoſe the Proof ought to be according to the Record, and the Record makes the Perjury differ from the Oath.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>I tell you that is to the form, and that will be ſav'd to you after the Verdict one way or the other.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Oates.</speaker>
               <p>Then will your Lordſhip be pleaſed to conſider there was a Record brought in, which is almoſt the ſame with that I am to offer to be read on my behalf, and which is the firſt Proof that I have to offer of the Conſult that was held in <hi>London</hi> in <hi>April</hi> 78. And I deſire Mr. <hi>Percivile</hi> may be called, I forget his Chriſtian-name, and Mr. <hi>Vaughan</hi> who is my Sollicitor: But pray, my Lord, let me firſt have the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Court, whether they did prove the words that I am ſaid to ſwear as they are laid in the Indictment.</p>

               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, very fully, we think ſo; but the Jury are to try that, that is a point of Fact: but if you will, you ſhall have our thoughts about it; We think they are fully proved.</p>

               <p>Well, if that be allowed for Evidence for me, I am contented to ſpare the time of the Court, not to read it again: but, my Lord, I offer this, and deſire to have Councel aſſign'd me to argue this point in Law; that is, Whether or no the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions and Attainders of <hi>Ireland, Whitebread,</hi> and the reſt of them, of a Treaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Conſult of the <hi>24th.</hi> of <hi>April</hi> 78. where it was reſolv'd to murder the late King, ought not to be taken as a ſufficient Legal Proof of the Fact, ſo long as thoſe Attainders remain of force? and whether the averment of that being falſe, is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived againſt thoſe Records.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>There is no difficulty in that at all in the world, Mr. <hi>Oates.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Oates.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I do not know the Law, and therefore I pray I may have Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel aſſign'd to argue that point.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>There is no queſtion in it. God forbid, if a Verdict be obtain'd by Perjury, that that Verdict ſhould protect the perjur'd party from being proſecuted for his falſe Oath. There were no Juſtice in that; nor is it an averment againſt a Record, for this is not a Writ of Error in fact that will reverſe it, but the Record remains a good Record and unimpeached ſtill: But though it be a good Record, yet it is lawful to ſay this Verdict was obtain'd upon the Teſtimony of ſuch an one, that forſwore himſelf in that Teſtimony, and for that particular Perjury he may ſurely be proſecuted.</p>

               <p>Yes, it is againſt the party attainted; but if that Attainder was founded upon a Verdict that was obtain'd by Perjury, God forbid, but he ſhould be told ſo that did perjure himſelf.</p>

               <p>Well, my Lord, if your Lordſhip rules that for Law, then I will go on; and I muſt now obſerve to the Jury in the opening the Evidence two things. Firſt, That the Indictment upon which <hi>Ireland</hi> was try'd, was found the <hi>16th.</hi> of <hi>December</hi> 78, and on the <hi>17th.</hi> of <hi>December,</hi> the next day, <hi>Ireland</hi> was try'd at the <hi>Old-Bailey;</hi> and then I find this Indictment brought againſt me for Perjury, is found at the <hi>Old-Bailey</hi> ſix years after the Fact by ſpecial Commiſſion. Now, I ſubmit it to your Lordſhips and the Juries conſideration, why the Preſentment and the finding of this Bill for Perjury has been ſo long delay'd, ſince it appears by the Evidence, that the Witneſſes that have been produc'd to prove the Perjury, were either at the Trial of the Five Jeſuits, or might have been produced then; and though they are not all the ſame perſons, yet they all bear the ſame Teſtimony that was then offered, but were not credited; and I hope when my Evidence is heard, they will have the ſame Reputation with this Jury that they had with thoſe others. My Lord, I muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint your Lordſhip and this Court, That in this Indictment for which Mr. <hi>Ireland</hi> was convicted, Mr. <hi>Whitebread</hi> and Mr. <hi>Fenwick</hi> did undergo part of the Tryal, and did hear the whole body of the Evidence that the Witneſſes teſtified againſt them; but there being but one Witneſs againſt them two at that time, which was my ſelf, (Mr. <hi>Bedloe</hi> being then upon an Intrigue, as your Lordſhip may remember) my Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Scroggs,</hi> who was then the mouth of the Court, did diſcharge the Jury of Mr. <hi>Whitebread</hi> and Mr. <hi>Fenwick,</hi> and remanded them to Priſon, which Mr. <hi>Whitebread</hi> ſix months after did remark to the Court, and urg'd it as a Plea for himſelf to be diſcharg'd: but that being over-rul'd by the Court, he was try'd. Now,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:102575:22"/>he had ſix months time to provide himſelf with new freſh Evidence to aſperſe me, and to endeavour to falſifie that Teſtimony I gave in againſt <hi>Whitebread</hi> and <hi>Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick,</hi> when <hi>Ireland</hi> was try'd, and ſo he knew what it was. I muſt further obſerve to you, my Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, That my Caſe is very hard, that ſince the ſubſtance of my Teſtimony was with credit receiv'd, and the Jury upon convicting them were acquainted, <q>That they had found an unexceptionable Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict; That all the Objections againſt the Evidence were then fully anſwer'd; That there was nothing that the Priſoners had been wanting in to object, which could be objected; and that the thing was as clear as the Sun.</q> And yet, after ſix years time, I muſt come to be called to an account for Perjury in my Teſtimony of that part of the Popiſh Plot, with which the King and Kingdom, four ſucceſſive Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments, all the Judges of the Land, and three Juries, were ſo well ſatisfied. I ſhall therefore offer to your Lordſhip and the Juries conſideration the unanimous Votes of three Houſes of Commons; I ſhall offer the Proceedings of the Houſe of Lords, that is the higheſt Judicature in the Kingdom; I ſhall prove what I have open'd by the Teſtimony of ſeveral Noblemen that are here, who will teſtifie this for me. My Lord, I ſhall prove, that ſeveral attempts have been made to baffle this Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, as that of the Murther of Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfrey,</hi> who took my Depoſitions, the Contrivance of <hi>Paine, Farewell,</hi> and <hi>Thompſon,</hi> made in the year 81 or 82, I forget which; I ſhall then produce Evidence that I was actually here in Town at the time in queſtion; and then upon the whole I ſhall ſubmit it to your Lordſhip and the Jury. But to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare your Lordſhip and the Jury the better for my Evidence, I would again urge the ſtrangeneſs of this Proſecution, and the hardſhip that is put upon me, to be tryed for Perjury in an Evidence given ſix years ago, and formerly very induſtriouſly, though not ſuccesfully, endeavoured to be falſified by ſixteen St. <hi>Omers</hi> Youths that were produced and examined before all the Judges in the Kingdom, and that not only once at <hi>Whitebread</hi>'s Trial, but a ſecond time at <hi>Langhorn</hi>'s Trial, in neither of which would the Jury believe them, becauſe of their Religion and Education, and the perſons under whom they were educated, who were men of known Artifice. Then, my Lord, I would this argue: If that time my Evidence were true, it muſt be true ſtill; for Truth is always the ſame; and if it were then true, and I can prove it to be true, 'twill be thought a hard thing without all doubt, that this ſhould be put upon me. Then, my Lord, I would fain know from my Proſecutors, Why this Indictment of Perjury has been deferred ſo long? Why theſe Witneſſes that come now to teſtifie this matter, and could then have been brought, did not come before, to juſtifie at the Trials of theſe perſons what they now ſay, which might have ſav'd their Lives, if true, and had been credited. Then I ſhall offer to your Lordſhip what I deſire You and the Jury would pleaſe to obſerve, That though the King's Councel are now againſt me, yet they are alſo againſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, for they were of Councel for the King in thoſe Caſes: particularly Mr. Solli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citor at <hi>Langhorn</hi>'s Trial, Sir <hi>Robert Sawyer</hi> at Sir <hi>George Wakeman</hi>'s Trial: They were of Councel before for the truth of my Teſtimony; they are now againſt it: I only mention that, and paſs it over. But this is not the firſt attempt that has been made to diſcredit the Teſtimony of the <hi>Popiſh Plot,</hi> as I told you before. Now, can it be ſuppoſed that the love and deſire of publick Juſtice can be the cauſe of this attempt to falſifie my Evidence after ſo many Trials, in which it has been credited and confirmed? Can any thing, my Lord, more plainly tend to deſtroy and ſubvert the methods of Juſtice, to frighten all Witneſſes from henceforth from ever appearing to diſcover any Conſpiracies? and does it not tend to expoſe and vilifie the known Underſtanding and Juſtice of the late King of ever Bleſſed Memory, to arraign the Wiſdom of His Privy-Council, His Great and Noble Peers, His Loyal Commons in three ſucceſſive Parliaments, His Twelve Judges, and all thoſe ſeveral Juries that were upon thoſe Trials? Had not thoſe Juries ſenſe? had they not honeſty? had they no conſciences? And the Judges before whom thoſe Conſpirators were try'd, were they men of no Juſtice, nor Honour, nor Integrity, nor Conſcience, nor Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding? Shall thoſe Juries be ſaid to have drawn the innocent Blood of theſe men upon their own Heads and the Nation? as, if I were perjur'd, it muſt be innocent Blood that was ſhed upon it.</p>

               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>No, no, that goes a great deal too far, Mr. <hi>Oates:</hi> The Jury have no ſhare, nor the Judges neither, in that Blood which was ſhed by your Oath.</p>
            </sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Oates.</speaker>
               <p>But this, I ſay, makes it moſt plain: The Evidence was then true, and I hope I ſhall make it as evidently plain 'tis as true now; and I do not queſtion, but upon the Evidence I ſhall now give, both Poſitive and Collateral, the Jury will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve me, and acquit me of this foul Accuſation. Pray my Lord be pleaſed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that when the Jury brought in <hi>Ireland</hi> guilty of the High-Treaſon of which he was accuſed and convicted him, <hi>Pickering,</hi> and <hi>Grove;</hi> ſays my Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Scroggs</hi> (that then was) to them, <q>
                     <hi>Gentlemen, you have done like very good Subjects, and very good Chriſtians, that is, like very good Proteſtants; and now much good may do them with their Thirty Thouſand Maſſes;</hi> as I ſhall prove he did ſay.</q> Then I inſiſt, in the ſecond place, That <hi>Whitebread</hi>'s Conviction does reinforce the Conviction of <hi>Ireland,</hi> becauſe of the attempt by the St. <hi>Omers</hi> Witneſſes to have overthrown my Evidence: But ſince I am attaqu'd again in the ſame kind by the violence of the Popiſh Intereſt, and by the malice of my Popiſh Adverſaries, I am contented to ſtand the Teſt with all my heart. And then, to conclude all, I ſhall ſhew the Court, That 'tis in vain for the Popiſh Party to expect and think to wipe their mouths, with <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Whore, and ſay <hi>they have done no wickedneſs:</hi> No, I queſtion not but thouſands of Proteſtants in this Kingdom are fully ſatisfied and convinced of the Truth of the Popiſh Plot, all and every part of it. Now, my Lord, if you pleaſe to give me leave to proceed on in my Evidence, I ſhall beg that theſe Records of Conviction may be read, which are my firſt Proof of the Conſult; and I ſhall then bring Witneſſes, <hi>viva voce,</hi> and ſhall make it appear, that what I did ſwear at thoſe Trials was true.</p>

               <p>Not to intetrupt you in your Defence, or the method you will take for it, I would put you upon that which is proper for you to apply your ſelf to, becauſe the queſtion now is not, Whether there was a Conſult or Congregation of the Jeſuits here upon the <hi>24th.</hi> of <hi>April</hi> 78? but the queſtion that toucheth you is, Whether you were preſent at any ſuch Conſult here in <hi>London</hi> the <hi>24th.</hi> of <hi>April</hi> 78? Theſe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, ſome of them, do ſay, there was a Conſult, and others that they heard of it, and believe there was ſuch an one, becauſe it was uſual to have a Triennal Congregation for ſome particular purpoſes: But the queſtion, is, Whether you have ſufficient proof to prove your ſelf to be here on the <hi>24th.</hi> of <hi>April</hi> 78, at which time it is agreed of all hands there was a Conſult?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>But will your Lordſhip be pleaſed to take notice of the drift of the Evidence, how they are conſiſtent one with another? Theſe Gentlemen that have now been ſworn to prove that I was not at this Conſult, do attempt to prove that I was at St. <hi>Omers:</hi> Now, to anſwer this, I ſhall not go about to prove that I was not then at St. <hi>Omers,</hi> but that I was actually then, and about that time, here in <hi>London;</hi> and then all that proof that Mr. Attorney-General has brought muſt be laid aſide.</p>

It will be convenient from what is already proved, to have them ſtay till more proof come in; 'Tis a great Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that is againſt them, but it not being ſufficient in point of Law. We diſcharge you of them. It is not a legal Proof to convict them by, whatſoever it may be to ſatisfie your conſciences.</hi>

               <p>Then I deſire Mr. <hi>Blayney</hi> would look into his Notes, what my Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Scroggs</hi> ſaid in his ſumming up the Evidence againſt <hi>Ireland:</hi> He mentions the Evidence of Sir <hi>Dennis Aſhburnham,</hi> who was produced to diſcredit me, and then he adds, <q>
                     <hi>When the matter is ſo accompanied with ſo many other circumſtances, which are material things, and cannot be evaded or deny'd, it is almost impoſſible for any man either to make ſuch a ſtory, or not to believe it when it is told.</hi>

               <p>My Lord, when I received a <hi>Subpoena</hi> from Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> to be here this day, and to bring my Notes of <hi>Ireland, Whitebread</hi> and <hi>Langhorns</hi> Trials, I did (as I did before upon another occaſion) make a ſearch for all my Notes, but could not find any but thoſe of the Trial of <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>Langhorn,</hi> and thoſe I have brought here, but have not <hi>Whitebread's.</hi>

               <p>No, they are no Evidence: If you can prove what was ſaid at any of them, you may by Witneſſes, but not by the Printed Books.</p>

               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>I believe I might ſay ſomething to the ſame purpoſe as you have read now.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Oates.</speaker>

               <speaker>Oates.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I have one paſſage more to urge, and that was my Lord, after the Jeſuits had been convicted, when the Jury brought in their Verdict, and found <hi>Whitebread, Fenwick, Harcourt, Gaven,</hi> and <hi>Turner</hi> guilty, your Lordſhip applying your ſelf to the Jury, ſaid thus to them; <q>
                     <hi>Gentlemen, you of the Jury, there has been a long Evidence given againſt the Priſoners at the Bar; they were all indicted, arraigned, and tried for High-Treaſon depending upon ſeveral circumſtances? They can none of them ſay the Court refuſed to hear any thing they could ſay for themſelves, but upon a long Evidence, and a patient hearing of the Defence they made, they are found guilty, and for any thing appears to us it is a juſt Verdict you have given.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>I believe I might ſay ſomething to that purpoſe too at that time; and no doubt the Jury did (as the Caſe then ſtood) find an unexceptionable Verdict.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Oates.</speaker>
               <p>There is another place, my Lord, that I would inſtance in, for your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips Opinion of the Evidence of the Popiſh Plot, and that is this: Now, my Lord, I bring your Lordſhip as you were of Councel for the King at Mr. <hi>Colledge</hi>'s Trial at <hi>Oxford,</hi> the <hi>17th.</hi> of <hi>August</hi> 81: There you, my now Lord Chief Juſtice, directing your ſelf to the Jury, had this expreſſion; <q>
                     <hi>We come not here to trip up the heels of the Popiſh Plot, by ſaying that any of them who ſuffer'd for it did die contrary to Law; for if Mr.</hi> Dugdale <hi>was not a perſon fit to be believed, or if the reſt of the Judges who try'd</hi> Gaven <hi>were out in the Law, then that man dy'd wrongfully; for he had as much right to be try'd according to Law as any other perſon whatſoever.</hi>
                  </q> This was your Lordſhips Opinion of the matter then, and your Lordſhip as Councel for the King did there deliver the Law as well as Fact to the Jury. If then they went againſt Law that would go to trip up the heels of the Popiſh Plot—</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Juſtice Withens.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>We are got into an endleſs Wood of ſayings of people, I know not where and when; and when all is done, 'tis to no purpoſe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Oates.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, it is a part, and a great part of my Defence, to ſhew what credit has been given to the Evidence of the Popiſh Plot.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Ay, but what Councel ſays at the Bar, or what Judges ſay in the Court of their Opinion is no Evidence of a Fact, of which the Jury are Judges only.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Oates.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, every Judge is upon his Oath, and delivers his Judgment according to his Oath.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Not as to the Fact, but only in points of Law, ſo as to tell the Jury what the Law is, if the Fact be ſo and ſo.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Oates.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, it goes a great way with the Jury to have the Judges Opinion.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Oates,</hi> deceive not your ſelf; all this you have inſiſted on hitherto, has not been to the purpoſe, nor is any ſort of Evidence in this caſe; and therefore do not run away with an opinion of this as Evidence: a Judges Opinion is of value in points of Law that ariſe upon Facts found by Juries, but are no Evidence of the Fact, for Judges only do preſume the Fact to be true, as it is ſound by the Jury; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:102575:24"/>ſay they, Out of that Fact ſo found, the point of Law ariſing is thus or thus. Then in Caſe, after a Jury has given a Verdict of the Fact, a Judges Opinion of the Fact, (which may be perhaps contrary to the Verdict) ſhould be an Evidence as to that Fact, that would be to overthrow and nullifie the Juries Verdict: No, that is not the Judges Province. Surely you would not have a Judges private Opinion, that Twelve men have found a Verdict againſt the Fact, to be an Evidence as to that Fact: No; but admit the Fact to be ſo or ſo, then the perſon convicted of the Fact ought to ſuffer ſo or ſo. And by the ſame reaſon as this, a Jury of honeſt Gentlemen here, when I tell them here is a plain Fact either to convict you or to acquit you upon this Indictment, are not bound to go by what I ſay in point of Fact, but they are to go according to their own Oaths, and according to the Evidence and Teſtimony of the Witneſſes: It is not my Opinion that is to weigh at all with them, whether you are Guilty of this Perjury, or are Innocent, but the Evidence that is given here in Court. Therefore what my Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Scroggs</hi> ſaid at any of thoſe Trials, or what I ſaid, or any other perſon, that either was of Councel, or a Judge on the Bench, ſaid as our Opinions, is but our Opinions on the Fact as it occurred to our preſent apprehenſions, but is no Evidence nor binding to this Jury. I muſt tell you, there is no doubt but that thoſe Juries did every one of them believe the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence you gave, or they would not have convicted the Priſoners. Do you think they would have found a Verdict againſt their own belief, and being upon their Oaths to make true Deliverance between the King and the Priſoners, have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured Themſelves to hang Others? If they had ſo done, they had committed Wilful Murther, and the worſt of Murthers too, being under colour of the Proceſs of Law; but yet all this is no Evidence. I do not diſcommend you for inſinuating theſe things as introductive and preparative to what Evidence you have to offer; but it is no Evidence one way or other. Alack-aday! how many times have we Cauſes here in <hi>Weſtminſter-hall,</hi> wherein we have Verdict againſt Verdict? and yet no imputation to either of the Juries, which might give different Verdicts upon different Grounds. There was a notable Caſe lately of my Lady. <hi>Ivies</hi> at this Bar: We all thought upon the firſt Trial, that ſhe had as good a Title to the Land as could be; all the Judges and the Councel went way (I believe) ſatisfied with the Juries Verdict for her: But when the Cauſe came to be heard again, we found all the Witneſſes to prove her Title, were guilty of notorious Porjury, and the ſame perſons which did believe before that ſhe was in the Right, and the Jury had done well, when they heard the ſecond Trial did believe ſhe was in the wrong, and accordingly the ſecond Jury found it ſo; and we believe that laſt Verdict to be good, without any reflection on the Credit of the Firſt Jury, becauſe the Evidence was as ſtrong on her ſide then, as it was afterwards againſt her. In theſe Caſes we give our Opinions always according to the preſent Teſtimony that is before us.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Oates.</speaker>
               <p>Then, my Lord, I offer this to your Conſideration, That thoſe men that were thus charged by me with High-Treaſon, were Prieſts and Jeſuits moſt of them, and particularly Mr. <hi>Ireland,</hi> in whoſe Trial I am ſaid to have committed this Perjury, and you ſhall find him to have been by others proved a Prieſt and a Jeſuit, and actually engaged in a Deſign againſt the Life of the King. If I then do prove that <hi>Ireland</hi> was engaged in a Deſign againſt the late Kings Life, and was a Prieſt and a Jeſuit, I deſire to know, Whether this be not a Collateral Evidence to render me of credit ſufficient, and ſupport my Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>By no means upon this Indictment. It's true it may give ſome credit to your Teſtimony, but is not of it ſelf ſufficient: Nay, I'll go a great way further than that; I will ſuppoſe that there was a Conſult of the Jeſuits upon the <hi>24th.</hi> of <hi>April</hi> 78 at the <hi>White-horſe-Tavern</hi> in the <hi>Strand,</hi> where thoſe you ſay were preſent, were all preſent, <hi>Ireland,</hi> and <hi>Whitebread,</hi> and <hi>Pickering, Grove</hi> and <hi>Fenwick,</hi> were all there, and that they did there come to a Reſolution to deſtroy the late King: Suppoſe all this to be true, and yet you all this time are not innocent of the Fact imputed to you, becauſe you ſwore directly, <hi>That You were there at that Conſult too,</hi> which you were not, if theſe men ſwear true, for then you were at St. <hi>Omers</hi> at that time; and therefore give us ſome ſort of Teſtimony to ſatisfie us that you were here,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:102575:24"/>and then you will ſet all right again. If the Jeſuits and Prieſts did Plot, that is nothing to make your Evidence true, if you ſwore that which you did not know of your own knowledge.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Oates.</speaker>
               <p>Shall it be allow'd then that <hi>Ireland</hi> was a Jeſuit and a Papiſt?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>There is the Evidence of a Record for it, my Lord; but if that be not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, I can call Witneſſes to prove it. Pray call Mr. <hi>Miles Prance,</hi>

               <p>My Lord, I ſaw him the latter-end of <hi>April:</hi> He came to Sir <hi>Richard Barker</hi>'s Houſe, where I did then live, and afterwards he came again thither within a few days. By this circumſtance I remember it; Sir <hi>Richard Barker</hi> my Maſter was ſick all the month of <hi>April,</hi> and in the Countrey, only he came now and then home for a little while, and went again: Now Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> came there when he was abſent, and a young man that lived in the Houſe came to me, and told me, There was Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> in the ſtrangeſt diſguiſe that ever was. Says he, I think he is turn'd Quaker: No, ſaid I, he is no Quaker, for they wear no Perriwigs, and I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buk'd the young Man for ſaying ſo.

I lookt upon him, and ſaw him at that time: And when he came that time, he went to Sir <hi>Richard</hi>'s Ladies Siſter, who is now in <hi>Wales,</hi> and coming to her, ſaid ſhe, <hi>Mr.</hi> Oates, <hi>I hear you are turn'd</hi> Jeſuit, <hi>and we can have no Society with you now:</hi> At laſt, he ſtay'd to Dinner with them, and ſtay'd moſt of the day there. Then he comes the latter-end of <hi>May; Whitſuntide</hi> was in <hi>May</hi> that year, and I know he came before <hi>Whitſuntide</hi> by this token; I ſpeak of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time of his coming: Our Cuſtom in the houſe was to Waſh and Scowr before the time, and I was ſending for a Woman to come and help to Waſh and Scowr, and then he was walking in the Garden, and the young man came and told me <hi>Oates</hi> was there: he came into the Pantry to me, Look, ſaid he, he is come again, and he is turn'd Jeſuit by his diſguiſe: Why <hi>Benjamin,</hi> ſaid I, what haſt thou to do with the man? canſt not let him alone?</p>

               <p>Then it is a full twelve months time and more from the <hi>May</hi> that he ſays he ſaw you at Sir <hi>Richard Barker</hi>'s, to <hi>Whitebread</hi>'s Tryal, in which he was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin'd the firſt time. Now that which I deſire of him is, to give me a reaſon why he remembers it was in the <hi>May</hi> was twelve-month before.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Butler.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, The Lady whom I did ſerve, dy'd in <hi>February</hi> before, that year:</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lord Ch. Juſtice.</speaker>
               <p>But give me ſome reaſon of your remembrance ſo long after.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Butler.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I do as well as I can.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lord Ch. Juſtice.</speaker>
               <p>Well, what is it?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Butler.</speaker>
               <p>My Lady was buried in <hi>February,</hi> and he comes into the Yard where I was cleaning my Coach, in <hi>May</hi> following that <hi>February,</hi> which was <hi>May</hi> before the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of the Plot. He ask'd me what alteration was in the Family? I told him my Lady was dead, and the Eſcutcheon was over the door for her. He ask'd for Doctor <hi>Tongue</hi> when he came firſt in the houſe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lord Ch. Juſtice.</speaker>
               <p>Why ſhould he ask for Doctor <hi>Tongue?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Butler.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, Doctor <hi>Tongue</hi> lodg'd there and he did ask for him: I come to juſtifie the Truth; upon my Salvation what I ſay is true.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lord Ch. Juſtice.</speaker>
               <p>Well, when he ask'd whether Doctor <hi>Tongue</hi> was within, what ſaid you?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Butler.</speaker>
               <p>I told him no, but he went into the Room where Doctor <hi>Tongue</hi> us'd to lie, but found him not there: So he went out again; that was the ſame time Mrs. <hi>Mayo</hi> ſaw him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lord Ch. Juſtice.</speaker>
               <p>But, Friend, prethee mind what I ask thee, becauſe thou muſt give me ſatisfaction how thou com'ſt to remember this, ſo as to be able to ſwear it; for his going to ask for <hi>Tongue,</hi> or the Eſcutcheon being over the door, neither of thoſe can be a reaſon for you to remember that this was in <hi>May,</hi> for the Eſcutcheon may be up in <hi>June,</hi> or in <hi>July,</hi> or in <hi>Auguſt,</hi> or in any other month after the time you ſpeak of: But how came you to take notice of this buſineſs that it was in <hi>May?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Butler.</speaker>
               <p>Sir <hi>Richard Barker</hi> my Maſter was then ſick at <hi>Putney,</hi> which was in <hi>May,</hi> though I cannot ſpeak to a day or a week particularly.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lord Ch. Juſtice.</speaker>
               <p>Then prethee let me ask thee this queſtion, How long had your Maſter been ſick before that?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Butler.</speaker>
               <p>He had never been well ſince my Lady dy'd.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lord Ch. Juſtice.</speaker>
               <p>When was it that your Lady dy'd?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Butler.</speaker>
               <p>In <hi>February</hi> before.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>How long after that did your Maſter Sir <hi>Richard Barker</hi> continue ſick?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Butler.</speaker>
               <p>Half a year, I believe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Why then, ſuppoſe your Maſter fell ſick immediately after your Lady died, and he continued ſick half a year after, yet all this while <hi>Oates</hi> might come du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his ſickneſs even in the month of <hi>June</hi> or <hi>July,</hi> when 'tis acknowledg'd he was in Town, and not be here in <hi>February,</hi> which is teſtified by a great many Witneſſes.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Butler.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I tell your Lordſhip the Truth, it was in <hi>May.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>But how doſt thou come to take notice it was in the month of <hi>May,</hi> ſo as to be able to ſwear it?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Butler.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I tell your Lordſhip my Lady was dead, and the Eſcutcheon was over the door.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>So it might be, tho' he came in <hi>June</hi> or <hi>July,</hi> I tell ye.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Butler.</speaker>
               <p>My Maſter was ſick at <hi>Putney</hi> at that time.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>How long did he lie ſick at <hi>Putney?</hi>

            <sp>

               <p>He was ſick there a fortnight, my Lord.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Then prethee when did thy Maſter go to <hi>Putney?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Butler.</speaker>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Butler.</speaker>
               <p>It was the latter-end of <hi>April,</hi> my Lord, as I remember.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>How long continu'd he ſick at <hi>Putney?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Butler.</speaker>
               <p>The matter of a fortnight.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Was not your Maſter ſick when your Lady dy'd at <hi>Putney?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Butler.</speaker>
               <p>No, he was not there then.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>When did he go to <hi>Putney,</hi> ſay ye?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Butler.</speaker>
               <p>He went not thither till the latter-end of <hi>April,</hi> my Lord.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>And did he continue at <hi>Putney</hi> but a fortnight.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Butler.</speaker>
               <p>Not at a time, but he continu'd going and coming a quarter of a year.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>But this was the firſt time of his going, was it:</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Butler.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, as I do remember.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Oates.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, he is my Witneſs, and I deſire I may examine him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>
                  <hi>L.</hi> C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Hold there, Mr. <hi>Oates;</hi> he is mine too: all the Witneſſes are mine to ſatisfie me in the truth of the Fact.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Oates.</speaker>
               <p>And to ſatisfie the Jury too, my Lord.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, and to ſatisfie the Jury too; but I muſt and will ſift out the truth, for both our ſatisfactions.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Oates.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, it is now, come the next month, ſix years ago ſince the Evidence of this matter was firſt given by theſe Witneſſes.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Then, Mr. <hi>Oates,</hi> I'll come a little rounder to you, and I'll put you into a certain way of clearing this buſineſs. I'll tell you what you ſhall do; You had a Lodging in Town, as well as Diet, and as well as you did eat at Doctor <hi>Barker</hi>'s ſometimes, ſo you eat and lay ſometimes elſewhere. You were here in Town a great while together, if your own aſſertions be true; for you were from <hi>April</hi> till <hi>June</hi> in Town. Now come and give us account by ſome Witneſſes, if you can, where did you lodge at that time, and where did you diet? for it ſeems you had but one meal at Sir <hi>Richard Barker</hi>'s.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Oates.</speaker>
               <p>Is that the queſtion, Sir, here in hand.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Ay indeed is it, and the main one too.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Oates.</speaker>
               <p>I beg your Lordſhips pardon if I miſtake, but I think that is not now in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion; for theſe St. <hi>Omers</hi> men do ſwear, That I was all <hi>April</hi> and <hi>May</hi> at St. <hi>Omers:</hi> Then if I do prove that in <hi>April</hi> and <hi>May</hi> I was not at St. <hi>Omers,</hi> but here in <hi>London,</hi> it is argument good enough againſt them that their Evidence is falſe. And indeed, can your Lordſhip or the Jury expect that I being then engag'd among &amp; for the Papiſts, &amp; afterwards an Evidence againſt them to diſcover their Treaſons, can bring any of them to teſtifie for me now? No, they will as certainly forſwear themſelves, as theſe young Fellows have all done.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Let me ask you a ſhorter queſtion; Did you always lie in a Papiſt houſe, all the two months you ſay you were here.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Oates.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I lay at ſeveral houſes.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Tell me the names of thoſe houſes, or any of them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Oates.</speaker>
               <p>It is not to the point in queſtion here, my Lord.</p>
            </sp>
            <pb n="49" facs="tcp:102575:27"/>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. Juſtice.</speaker>
               <p>Yes it is very much; But I perceive it is a Secret, and let any body judge why.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Oates.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, They that have by the principles of their Religion, Liberty, to affirm or deny any thing, and can have diſpenſations for the violations of Oaths and Sacraments, certainly are not to be admitted as witneſſes in ſuch a caſe as this.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. Juſtice.</speaker>
               <p>Talk not to me of Diſpenſations and I know not what; I ſpeak from a plain demonſtrative Proof: can it be believed that you ſhould be here in <hi>England</hi> ſo long, and as they ſay, publickly, and no perſon living ſee you that we can hear of, but an Old Woman that never ſaw you, nor knew you before, and a Coachman that tells a wild ſtory without reaſon: if you will not tell me where you lay, can you tell me where you did eat all that time.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Oates.</speaker>
               <p>I can tell where I did lye that time.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Do ſo then. Let us hear it, that will be your beſt defence.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Oates.</speaker>
               <p>Is that the point My Lord, in queſtion.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Ay upon my word is it the main point in this Caſe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Oates.</speaker>
               <p>If it ſhould go upon that foot my Lord, it is impoſſible for me now to prove it; for 'tis well known I lay ſometimes with Mr. <hi>Whitebread,</hi> and ſometimes with Mr. <hi>Mico,</hi> neither of which can I have to teſtify for me; and beſides, I muſt inſiſt upon it, theſe things were in queſtion at <hi>Whitebreads</hi> Trial, nor do I believe that Mr. <hi>Whitebread,</hi> if askt at his death, would have juſtified, and ſtood by it, that I was not here then.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Well, This I muſt certainly ſay, I cannot help it, but it will ſtick with me till better anſwered. I can never be ſatisfied, that if you were here ſo long, there ſhould no better evidence be produc'd to prove you here.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Oates.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, nor can I help your diſſatisfaction, but I am to ſatisfy all that hear me this day, that it is a very hard Caſe that is put upon me; I have taken the moſt effectual courſe that I could, to provide for Evidence to make my defence, and I think, by your Lordſhips good leave, thoſe that I have produc'd, do prove me here in Town in <hi>April</hi> and <hi>May</hi> 78. And if your Lordſhip has done with this Witneſs, I'le call another.</p>

               <p>Truly my Lord, I do not find in the Examination of the St. <hi>Omers</hi> Witneſſes, you were ſo ſtrict, or bore half ſo hard upon them, as you do upon my Witneſſes, what does it ſignifie my Lord, whether the Wigg were long or ſhort, black or brown?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>We have no other way to detect Perjuries, but by theſe Circumſtances; and 'tis the duty of a Judge to enquire into all Particulars: as in a Controverſie about words, were they ſpoken in Latin or in Engliſh, and ſo to all places and poſtures of ſitting, riding, or the like; as you know the Perjury of the Elders in the caſe of <hi>Suſanna,</hi> was by their different Teſtimony in particular Circumſtances diſcovered.</p>

            <sp>

               </speaker>
               <p>Yes I did, and I ſpeak nothing here, but what I ſpeak as in the preſence of the Lord.</p>

               <p>Sir, I'le give you the beſt ſatisfaction I can to the beſt of my knowledge; he came to Sir <hi>Richard Barker</hi>'s one evening, and there he enquired for Doctor <hi>Tongue:</hi> he was in a diſguiſe, in a light coloured Coat, ſomething like to Frize, but it was not Frize; the term that they give it, I cannot ſo readily tell: he had his hair cut ſhort almoſt to his ears, and he had a broad-brim'd Hat on, and a ſmall ſtick in his hand, walking melancholly about the Hall: I happening to be the firſt body he met with as I ſuppoſe, he asked me if Doctor <hi>Tongue</hi> was within; I told him no, I had not ſeen him of a conſiderable time: he then asked me where Sir <hi>Richard Barker</hi> was; I told him he was ill now at <hi>Putney;</hi> ſays he, when will he be here; I told him I could not tell.</p>

               <p>You muſt not ask queſtions in that manner. It is propereſt for you to propoſe your queſtions to the Court, and they will ask the Witneſſes.</p>

               <p>My Lord, I have been interrogated in former times upon this point, ſix or ſeven years ago, and I do confeſs I did ſee the man, and met him between St. <hi>Martins-lane</hi> and <hi>Leiceſter-fields;</hi> and truly my Lord I think I may ſay it was my unhappineſs to meet with him; for I have had a great deal of trouble by it ſince, Subpoena upon Subpoena, trouble after trouble, that I am even weary of it; for I am an old man: but I do ſay I did meet him at that end of the Town, between St. <hi>Martins-lane</hi> and <hi>Leiceſter-fields</hi> in a ſtrange diſguiſe, he was juſt like a Vagrant, a very Raſcal, and that's true I believe, my Lord.</p>

               <p>My Lord, I cannot preſcribe the time, but I'le gueſs as near as I can with the beſt probability, and that is, upon this circumſtance; when I went forward into <hi>Leiceſter-fields,</hi> in the Court before the Houſe, I ſaw the Elm-Trees budded forth as big as an Hazle-Nut: ſo that I did conjecture by that Token, it might be between <hi>Lady-day,</hi> the latter end of <hi>April;</hi> that was the time as near as I could gueſs.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>But that we are not to take notice of, without the Record be brought in Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence before us: we muſt go according to the courſe of Law in all Caſes.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Oates.</speaker>
               <p>Then my Lord, I muſt betake my ſelf to another part of my defence, and that is to prove the frequent attempts made to baffle the Diſcovery of this Popiſh Plot, and to ſtifle the Murder of Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfrey,</hi> and to fling it upon a Proteſtant Peer.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>But that is no Evidence neither.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Juſt. Holloway.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>Surely that is very Collateral Evidence.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Nay, it is no Evidence at all in this Caſe; we muſt not admit of any ſuch Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to be given.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Oates.</speaker>
               <p>Good my Lord, if this had not been true, which was ſworn by Witneſſes that had diſcovered the Plot, why ſhould theſe Men appear to ſuborn Witneſſes (and they have been Convicted of Subornation, and endeavouring) to baffle the Diſcovery, particularly as to Juſtice <hi>Godfrey</hi>'s Death?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Oates,</hi> I muſt keep you to Evidence that is proper; we are upon our Oaths to go according to Law, and the Jury are upon their Oaths to Try this Cauſe according to their Evidence; and we are bound to give them this advice in point of Law, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing muſt weigh, or have any conſideration with them, that you offer if it be not legal and proper Evidence: if you can ſay and prove that any of the Witneſſes that have been produc'd this day againſt you, have been tamper'd with; or that they have tamper'd with any of the former Evidence, that is a good Evidence againſt them; but it muſt not be by any means admitted that the time of the Court be taken up, or the Jury enveigled by that which has not a natural tendency to the buſineſs before us.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Oates.</speaker>
               <p>But if your Lordſhip pleaſe, this Conſult in <hi>April</hi> 78. was diſcovered to the Houſe of Commons among the other parts of the Diſcovery of the Treaſons of ſeveral Noble Men and Gentlemen: now upon the whole diſcovery of the Plot, I would deſire that I might give in proof the Proceedings of the Houſe of Commons.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>No, no, you cannot.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Oates.</speaker>
               <p>Pray my Lord, is not the Journal of the Houſe of Commons Evidence?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>No, we ſay it is not at all.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Oates.</speaker>
               <p>Is that the Opinion of the whole Court my Lord?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, undoubtedly, there is no queſtion of it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Oates.</speaker>
               <p>Is any Record of the Houſe of Lords Evidence?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, I tell you it is, and that becauſe it is a Record; but there is a vaſt diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the Records of the Houſe of Lords, and the Journals of the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Oates.</speaker>
               <p>The Journals have been delivered in as Evidence before now.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>I cannot tell what they have been, but I am ſure they ought not to be, and whatever they have been elſewhere, they cannot be here; and I'le tell you a plain reaſon for it, becauſe they have not ſo much power in the Houſe of Commons as to give an Oath: but the Houſe of Peers is a Court of Record, and therefore their Proceedings are Evidence as the Proceedings of the Kings Bench here; or any other Court of Record are.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Oates.</speaker>
               <p>Then my Lord if that part of my Evidence be over-rul'd; before I come to ſumm up my Evidence, I deſire to offer this thing. My Lord, I can produce ſeveral Members of the Houſe of Commons in the ſeveral Parliaments, that can remember how they proceeded againſt the Lords in the Tower, and the Popiſh Traitors upon my Diſcovery, and what credit I had in the Houſe of Commons; Will that be Evidence pray my Lord?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>No, it will not, if you will produce any one that you told this to before the publick Diſcovery, that may be Evidence ſuch as it is, and is often allow'd; but what the Houſe of Commons did upon the Diſcovery, that's not any Evidence at all.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Oates.</speaker>
               <p>Then my Lord, ſuppoſe I can prove, that I gave an Early and Timely account to any of the Houſe of Lords of this Conſpiracy, and did acquaint them with the Conſult in <hi>April</hi> as part of it; I deſire to know whether in producing any of thoſe Lords, I ſhall give that which is Evidence.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Call whom you will that you told any thing to, that is a ſort of Evidence, I tell you?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Oates.</speaker>
               <p>Then I call my Lord of <hi>Devonſhire.</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord of <hi>Devonſhire,</hi> your Lordſhip muſt be ſworn <stage>(which was done.)</stage>

               <p>Will your Lordſhip be pleaſed to acquaint the Court and the Jury (your Lordſhip being at that time a Member of the Commons Houſe) what an account I gave there of this particular Conſult (to keep to that point that is here in queſtion) before the Court this day, and with what credit I was received in all theſe Parliaments; for my Credit and the Credit of the Parliament is now in queſtion.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>E. of <hi>Devonſhire.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>My Lord, all I can ſay to it is this; you Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> gave a long account of a Conſult and Conſpiracy among the Jeſuits: but I cannot remember any particular, it is ſo long ago.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Every Body knows this, you gave a long Narrative into the Houſe of Commons and Houſe of Lords too.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Oates.</speaker>
               <p>Ay, and it was a true one; but my Lord of <hi>Devonſhire,</hi> I deſire your Lordſhip would be pleaſed to give the Court and the Jury an account, with what credit I was received in thoſe Three Parliaments your Lordſhip ſat as Member in.</p>
            </sp>

               <speaker>E. of <hi>Devonſhire.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>I remember that the two <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Parliaments after the long Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, were ſo ſatisfied with the Diſcovery, that they paſſed a Vote in the Houſe of Commons—</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>The Votes of the Houſe of Commons are no Evidence at all.</p>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Many Votes that have been made of late, I hope will neither be Evidence for, nor put in practice again.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>E. of <hi>Devonſhire.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>My Lord, it is well known to all the World the Vote I ſpeak of.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Nay my Lord I ſpeak not to your Lordſhip; for we all know thoſe Votes that I ſpeak of were not according to your Lordſhips mind: But we only ſay thus in General, that becauſe the Houſe of Commons cannot give an Oath, therefore what is done there, is not an Evidence here, or in any Court of Record.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Oates.</speaker>
               <p>But my Lord, that I muſt urge, I do perceive that in the time of Parliament, and during the Sitting of the Houſe of Commons, Votes have been brought in as Barrs to the Proceedings of Inferior Courts; and this Court does not look upon it ſelf as Superior to the Great Court of Parliament, and then if they may be brought—</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Which they cannot be, nor never were, nor I am ſure ought to be; nor I hope never will be as long as there is any Juſtice in the Nation.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Oates.</speaker>
               <p>But my Lord you will allow the Records of the Houſe of Lords to be Evidence?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, I tell you I will, and for that reaſon, becauſe they are Records out of a Court of Record: an Order of Court Baron is no Evidence, becauſe it is no Court of Record; but a Judgment of a Court Leet is Evidence, becauſe it is a Court of Record; and there's the difference.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Oates.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I call in the next place my Lord of <hi>Angleſey,</hi> if he be in Court.</p>

               <p>My Lord, my Memory is never very good; but eſpecially in a caſe that is at ſuch a diſtance of time, and which conſiſts of ſo many Particulars as this, I mean Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> Diſcovery. But this my Lord I do remember; he was examin'd at the Bar of the Houſe of Commons and gave a long account: but it is more than any man can do to tell every Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular that is ſaid in that Houſe.</p>

               <p>My Lord, my queſtion is this, when I was brought to the Bar of the Lords Houſe, whether I did not receive the thanks of the Lords Houſe for my Diſcovery?</p>

               <speaker>E. of <hi>Clare.</hi>

               <p>But now Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> I hope you are ſatisfied by the anſwer that is given by your own Witneſs, that what is done in the Houſe of Commons, is no Evidence; and I would have you remember that is the Reaſon of it, becauſe they are no Court of Record, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they cannot ſo much as give an Oath.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Oates.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I ſee my Lord of <hi>Huntingdon</hi> is here; and tho I did not Subpoena his Lordſhip, nor deſign'd to have troubled him; yet being here, I deſire his Lordſhip would give the Court an account what Credit I had in the Houſe of Lords upon my Diſcovery.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>I do believe my Lord, Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> Diſcovery found a good reception in the Houſe of Lords; but it was grounded upon the opinion, that what he ſaid was true, and that he was an honeſt man: for ſo the Houſe then accounted him to be; and upon this it was their Lordſhips gave credit to his Teſtimony; and indeed had the matter been true, it was of high Importance to have it thorougly examined: But ſince that time it being apparent there were ſo many, and great Contradictions, Falſities, and Perju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:102575:32"/>in his Evidence; upon which ſo much innocent blood hath been ſhed, I believe a great many Perſons who were concerned in the Trials of thoſe unfortunate men, are heartily afflicted and ſorry for their ſhare in it: And I do believe moſt of the Houſe of Peers have altered their opinion, as to this mans credit; and look upon his Evidence as I do, to be very falſe.</p>

               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Nay, but with your favour, it was to declare what opinion the Houſe of Lords had of you; and he ſays very well, and that is in truth the ſame anſwer that muſt be given, for the Judges and the Juries that try'd the People upon your Evidence: ſays my Lord of <hi>Huntingdon</hi> at firſt, truly I did believe Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> did ſwear true, and he had credit with me, and ſo he had with others; But now upon further Examination into things, and in proceſs of time Diſcoveries have been made of the truth, and that what he ſwore, is falſe; ſo that now I believe in my Conſcience he is actually forſworn, and has drawn inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Blood upon the Nation; and no body will believe a word he ſays.</p>

               <p>My Lord, I call'd your Lordſhip, becauſe your Lordſhip ſate as a Commiſſioner of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer</hi> in the <hi>Old-Bayly,</hi> at <hi>Ireland, Whitebread</hi> and <hi>Langhorn</hi>'s Tryals; and that which I call your Lordſhip for, is to give an account to my Lord and the Jury, of the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction your Lordſhip received concerning the fullneſs and fairneſs of the Evidence then deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd by me in thoſe Tryals.</p>

               <speaker>L. C. Baron.</speaker>
               <p>No not in particular; but in general I remember there was a great many Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that gave Evidence in thoſe Tryals on the one ſide and the other: There were a great many Perſons that came from St. <hi>Omers,</hi> that gave Evidence there of Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> being at St. <hi>Omers,</hi> when he ſaid he was in Town.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Oates.</speaker>
               <p>And what Credit were they of at that time, pray my Lord?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. Baron.</speaker>
               <p>I think they were Perſons of very good Credit; they were Gentlemen of good Families many of them.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Oates.</speaker>
               <p>Did the Jury believe them at that time?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Oates.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I am not at all concern'd at this; I value my ſelf more upon my own Innocency and Integrity, than any Man's good or bad Opinion whatſoever.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>

               <p>Ah!

               <p>I know not what anſwer to make about the credit he there had: any Member of the Houſe of Commons may give as good and better an account in that matter than I; and truly I do not remember that Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> was before the Barr of the Houſe when I was Speaker: I believe it was before I was Speaker, that he was Examined at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons Barr.</p>

               <p>Theſe things, my Lord, will ſhow of what Credit he was of at that time: Another thing we ſay to theſe Records, is this; There were two other Witneſſes, Mr. <hi>Clay</hi> and Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> beſides thoſe that were now produced, which were the home Witneſſes, that did poſitively ſwear, that in <hi>April</hi> and <hi>May</hi> 78. <hi>Oates</hi> was here in Town: he did then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed make uſe of thoſe other canting Witneſſes, for I cannot call them any otherwiſe, that beat ſo about the Buſh, and ſpeak of uncertainties, and contradict one another; but thoſe that I name, <hi>Clay</hi> and <hi>Smith,</hi> were home Witneſſes, and there lay the Credit of his being in Town, when the Witneſſes which came from St. <hi>Omers,</hi> ſay he was beyond Sea.</p>

               <p>My Lord, I beg I may ask one thing; whether my Lord Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> be there ſtill?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>No, my Lord of <hi>London</hi> is gone.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Oates.</speaker>
               <p>I am ſorry for it, becauſe he could have given an account of this <hi>Smith,</hi> for he knows him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>I cannot help it, you ſhould have deſir'd him to ſtay while he was here; go on Mr. <hi>Attorney.</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Att. Gen.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>I will my Lord; and this which I am going to ſay, as an anſwer to his Evidence, which will give a full anſwer to that other Objection which he made, which was, what was the Reaſon, when he had given ſuch an Evidence ſo long ago, it ſhould be delayed ſo long e're it was proſecuted. I'le give your Lordſhip a Reaſon and a ſatisfactory one, till thoſe Diſcoveries were made that have lately been made: The Evidence theſe Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes gave, carried a probability of truth in it; and Sir <hi>Richard Barker</hi> himſelf added his Teſtimony to it, tho he does not think fit now to come and confirm it: I ſay hitherto it had ſome ſemblance of truth, and ſo did ballance the other Teſtimony of them that came from St. <hi>Omers:</hi> But when we had diſcover'd that it could be teſtified by twenty Perſons, that had not been at any of the former Tryals, that he was certainly all that time at St. <hi>Omers;</hi> and when we had diſcover'd the Tampering and Practices of Mr. <hi>Oates,</hi> in Suborning theſe Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes to ſwear as corruptly as he ſwore at firſt; which we ſhall ſhow you palpably to be true that he did ſo; that gave us encouragement to go on to make enquiry into the matter; but this was not diſcover'd till half a year ago, or thereabouts. Now as to one of thoſe Witneſſes, that is Mr. <hi>Clay,</hi> the caſe ſtands thus; indeed I expected he would have brought
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:102575:34"/>the ſame Witneſſes he did then; for I preſume they are all about Town, but he has not thought fit to do that: This <hi>Clay</hi> was then a Prieſt, and a Priſoner in the Gate-houſe for that very reaſon as being accuſed for being a Romiſh Prieſt; while he was there a Priſoner, Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> comes and threatens him, and ſollicits him to ſwear that he was here in Town in <hi>May</hi> 78. that he might be provided with proof againſt what the Boys of St. <hi>Omers</hi> (as he call'd them) would come to teſtifie; and threaten'd him if he did not, he would hang him, for he could ſwear him to be a Prieſt; and this was about three or four days before the Tryal of the Five Jeſuits: At length they came to a Bargain and Agreement, as you will hear, that he ſhould come and ſwear this; when Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> cannot pretend that the Evidence of <hi>Clay</hi> was known at all by any of the Committees that were concern'd in the management of his Diſcovery; or that he was ſo much as though of for a Witneſs. But we ſhall prove how it came to paſs; and I believe, if Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> would call him now, (as I do not queſtion he knows where to have him) <hi>Clay</hi> would not be ſo hardy now, as to affirm his former Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony. Then as for Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> his Caſe ſtands thus: Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> had ſworn him into the Plot, as you will find in his Narrative that he gave in upon Oath, which is upon Record, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd in the Journals of the Lords Houſe. He was a School-Maſter in <hi>Iſlington,</hi> and <hi>Oates</hi> ſwears High Treaſon againſt him; and thereupon Warrants went out to take this <hi>Smith,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> was very violent in the purſuit of him but two or three days before the Tryal; and then, when all theſe Witneſſes from St. <hi>Omers</hi> were come, as he knew very well, he was in ſome doubt his deſign would have fail'd, and then does he prevail with <hi>Smith</hi> to become a Witneſs for him. And 'tis evident he did tamper with him, from that which was done by him at that time: For now he gives him under his hand, (to ſhew the Impudence, as well as Villany of the man) as it has been evident enough in all his carriage) a Paper that ſhould give him Authority to go free from all Proceſs and Arreſts upon any Warrants; and this Protection under Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> hand, is directed to all the Kings Officers, thereby commanding them to take notice that this Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> whom before he had accus'd of being in the Plot, was an honeſt man, and employed in great Service for the King at that time. This Paper, when produc'd, will ſhow the time when it was made; and then it will appear, that two days after <hi>Smith</hi> comes and Swears that he din'd with him the firſt Monday in <hi>May</hi> in 78. This was what <hi>Smith</hi> ſwore then; and upon my mentioning of this Practice, if he have any ſhame in him, it muſt put him in ſome confuſion: for we are prepar'd to prove by undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Teſtimony, that Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> did not dine with this Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> that day: we ſhall prove it by the whole Family; but the firſt time ever Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> came there, was in <hi>July</hi> after, when he came into <hi>England</hi> from St. <hi>Omers,</hi> which theſe Witneſſes ſay, was the latter end of <hi>June.</hi> Then it was that he was with Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> and came to his Houſe, and not before. And we ſhall prove by ſeveral Witneſſes, that upon the queſtions being asked of Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> how he came to teſtifie ſuch a thing, his anſwer was, I muſt have died for it, if I had not don't, 'twas only a miſtake in point of time: But he threatned me, and ſo did ſome others too, that he would have me hang'd for being in the Plot, if I did not comply with him, and ſwear this for him. My Lord, I ſhall offer this Evidence that I have open'd, and then I hope we ſhall ſatisfie the Jury, and all that hear this Tryal, that he is one of the moſt notorious Villains that liv'd upon the Earth; to be ſure that ever was known in this Kingdom.</p>

               <p>Well my Lord, we ſubmit it to you; but we will now go on to prove that which Mr. <hi>Attorney</hi> opened, that <hi>Oates</hi> did ſuborn theſe Witneſſes to ſwear what they did ſwear: you have had one part of the Evidence that was then given; now we ſhall prove that <hi>Clay</hi> was ſworn at <hi>Whitebreads</hi> Trial, and what he did there teſtify about <hi>Oates</hi> being in Town.</p>

               <p>Truly my Lord I always took it, that we need not come to prove a man was actually ſworn to his anſwer; but if it be once enter'd upon Record in Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery, it proves it ſelf.</p>

And in the month of <hi>Auguſt</hi> the Deponent was ordered by the Jeſuits in <hi>London,</hi> to give the ſaid Perſons great Reſpects, and in their names to thank the Club for their faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to them in that particular.</q>

               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>I ſee not any Plot, for my part, that he ſwore him into, unleſs you mean Treaſon againſt the Houſe of Commons: for that is the Accuſation he made, that he ſpoke ſuch words of the Houſe of Commons. Pray read it again. <stage>(Which was done.)</stage>

               <p>Then my Lord, we'l call Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> himſelf, and he will tell you how <hi>Oates</hi> drew him in: Swear Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> 
                  <stage>(which was done)</stage> pray acquaint my Lord and the Jury, how you came to ſwear at the former Tryal; by whom you were perſwaded, and how you varied from the Truth.</p>

               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>That is very nauſeous and fulſome Mr. Attorney, methinks in a Court of Juſtice.</p>

               <p>What did you ſwear in the former Tryal? and was that true you did ſwear then?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>I tell you truly Mr. Attorney, it looks rank and fulſome: if he did forſwear himſelf, why ſhould he ever be a Witneſs again?</p>

               <p>I am ſure 'tis not fit to be allow'd at any time: If he did forſwear himſelf in a Court of Record, in my opinion he is not to be receiv'd as a Witneſs any more.</p>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Pray call ſome other Witneſſes, if you have them, to contradict him; but do not offer to bring a man to ſwear that he did forſwear himſelf before.</p>
            </sp>

               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Soll. Gen.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>My Lord, we give Evidence here of a mans being produc'd by <hi>Oates,</hi> to ſwear he was here in <hi>May</hi> 78. and he did make ſuch an Oath: now I hope, with Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion my Lord, it is Evidence to contradict that Oath, if we can prove that he has confeſſed he was forſworn, and miſtaken in his Oath; ſuch Evidence perhaps will be of little value, yet Evidence it is.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Make it what you will, Mr. Sollicitor; I think it is of no value at all, nor to be admitted for the man to come and ſwear it himſelf: prove what you can by others.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Soll. Gen.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>Surely my Lord, this Confeſſion of his to others is of leſs value, than when we bring the Man himſelf to confeſs his fault; that Man himſelf coming and owning the thing, that he was miſtaken, with great ſorrow for it, ſure is a good Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>

               <p>My Lord, I muſt ſubmit it to you, but then I humbly conceive, it will be in very many Caſes impoſſible to detect a Perjury or Subornation, if the Party ſuborn'd cannot be admitted to be a witneſs.</p>

               <p>My Lord, afterwards I was Keeper to him under the other Keeper, and he had a Keeper to wait on him to Newgate Seſſions at the <hi>Old Baily;</hi> wherefore this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman that is ſtanding there, Mr. <hi>Oates,</hi> comes to us, ſays he, Do not you trouble your ſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this Priſoner; let him alone with me, I'll ſee him at home again; and then the Jeſuits there did take their Trials: how it was I cannot tell; for we could not come into the Court: afterwards they went to the Fountain Tavern by Newgate to Dinner, and Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> and he went to Dinner together; we were below in the houſe waiting there till it was Night, and ſtill thinking that he ſhould come down again; but away went he home, and left us in the lurch; but indeed he did come home to the Priſon very honeſtly and civilly, becauſe he was civilly guarded.</p>

               <p>It was, That he muſt ſwear, That Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> dined at Mr. <hi>Howard</hi>'s houſe ſuch a day of the month, and Mr. <hi>Clay</hi> did ſay he knew nothing of the matter, but then Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> and Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> did reply to him again, here's your Choice; if you will not ſwear this, we will try you for a Prieſt, and hang you, and ſo <hi>Clay</hi> agreed; if he might have his money reſtored that was taken from him, he had been a Rogue before, and did not know what he might do.</p>

               <p>Now, my Lord, here is an Indictment preferr'd againſt me for Perjury and the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence they have given for the King, is this, 1. They have call'd Mr. <hi>Foſter,</hi> and he tells you that I was produced at the Seſſions-houſe in the <hi>Old Baily,</hi> where he was ſummon'd as a Jury man, upon the Trial of <hi>Ireland;</hi> and he ſays, That when I was produc'd at the Seſſions in the <hi>Old Baily</hi> as a Witneſs, and ſworn, (if I do remember Mr. <hi>Foſter</hi> aright in what he ſays) he did hear me ſwear, That there was a Treaſonable Conſult of Jeſuits upon the twenty fourth of April 78. at the White-Horſe-Tavern in the <hi>Strand;</hi> and he does further ſay, That I ſaid thoſe Jeſuits afterwards came to a Reſolution to kill the King; and that they ſeparated themſelves into leſſer Clubs; the Reſolution being drawn up by one <hi>Mico;</hi> and that I carryed it from Chamber to Chamber to be ſigned, and did ſee it ſigned. My Lord, I did ask Mr. <hi>Foſter,</hi> Whether I in my Evidence called it a Conſult, or a Traite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Conſult. Now, my Lord, 'tis true I did call it a Traiterous Conſult; it is as true that I did ſwear there was ſuch a Conſult; and it is as true that I did ſwear this Conſult did divide it ſelf into leſſer Companies; it is as true that I did ſay I did carry that Reſolution about from Chamber to Chamber, and ſaw them ſign that Reſolution for murdering the King, I do not mean of this King, but of the late King. My Lord, the Evidence I think I nor no honeſt man ſhall need to be aſham'd of; I am not aſhamed to own that I repeated this Evidence ſeveral times, nor that I gave that Evidence upon Oath; for it is Truth, my Lord, and nothing but Truth, and I reſolve by the Grace of God to ſtand by it and confirm it with my Blood, if there be occaſion. My Lord, to Convict me of Perjury, they have brought a parcel of St. <hi>Omers</hi> Witneſſes, and theſe do ſwear that which they would have ſworn ſix years ago; but then the Court thought them not fit to be ſworn, not only becauſe the Law will not allow them, but becauſe of their Religion, that can diſpenſe with falſe Oaths, if it were for a good Cauſe, and that was the Remark my Lord <hi>C.</hi> Juſtice <hi>Scroggs</hi> then made of it. I ſhall not inſiſt much upon what they have ſworn, for that I ſuppoſe your Lordſhip and the Jury do very well Remember: But I have five things to Object to their Evidence; and I hope the Jury will take notice of my Objections, and make their Remarks upon them; for ſince you have heard the Evidence that is brought againſt me, it will be neceſſary for your Lordſhip to weigh the nature of theſe Witneſſes and the Value, that the ſeveral Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Middleſex</hi> had for them. 'Tis true there are ſeveral brought here now, that never were Witneſſes before; there are indeed other men, but of the ſame Religion and the ſame Intereſt, and therefore their Teſtimony muſt be of the ſame Value; I think your Lordſhip will allow me that: Therefore I Begin with their Religion, and that I take notice to be a great Objection to their Evidence, as I am adviſ'd by thoſe that are Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Law. And I muſt appeal to the Court, whether a Papiſt in Caſe of Religion may be believed and received as a good Witneſs?</p>

               <p>Yes, my Lord, you have; but I hope I have right to urge it.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Oates.</speaker>
               <p>I will keep to the matter, my Lord, if you will hear me.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Oates.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I do inſiſt upon it, that theſe mens Religion is an exception to their Teſtimony, and a Papiſt is not a good witneſs in a Cauſe of Religion; and I deſire I may have leave to argue that as a Point of Law in my own defence.</p>

               <p>Then I offer you one thing more, my Lord, and that is what was ſaid and done in the Caſe of the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> when he was charged with High Treaſon, and committed to the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> at ſeveral Seſſions in the <hi>Old Baily</hi> and at <hi>Hicks'</hi>s <hi>Hall;</hi> they did move that they might have liberty to bring in an Indictment of Perjury againſt the witneſſes which did accuſe him of Treaſon, but now the Court there over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled thoſe Motions, and would not ſuffer my Lord of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi>'s Friends to bring Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictments of Perjury againſt him, becauſe they would not have the King's Evidence Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted of Perjury, nor the Popiſh Plot called in queſtion; This is matter of Fact in the <hi>Old Baily.</hi>

               <p>My Lord, I deſire to ſpeak but theſe few words then, as to my own Witneſſes I have produced. And the firſt is <hi>Cicely Mayo;</hi> and, my Lord, though it be your Lordſhips pleaſure, not to have that good opinion of her, as I think the poor woman does deſerve, yet I hope her Evidence, will have it's due Weight and Conſideration with your Lordſhip,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:102575:40"/>and the Jury; ſhe ſays, ſhe ſaw me in Town in the Month of <hi>May:</hi> Now indeed ſhe could not be poſitive, what <hi>May</hi> it was, but ſhe ſaid it was the May before the Popiſh Plot broke out, that is before the Rumour of that Plot was ſpread abroad, and ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves the Plot broke out in 78. But this ſhe ſays poſitively, ſhe ſaw me in the Month of <hi>May</hi> here; my Lord, ſhe comes to give this Evidence freely and voluntarily; a man that is a Knave is a Knave for ſomething, either out of Malice, or for Gain or Intereſt; but ſhe has no Reward given her, nor can hope for any, but in Love to Juſtice, without any by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>end or particular Intereſt; ſhe came here to teſtifie the truth, about her ſeeing me in <hi>London</hi> in <hi>May</hi> 78. The next Witneſs is Mr. <hi>Butler,</hi> he was then Sir <hi>Richard Barker</hi>'s Coachman. He lived ſome years with him, as his Servant; but he is now ſet up for himſelf, and he ſays, that when he was about his Maſters Buſineſs in the Coach-yard, and fitting the Coach for to fetch his Maſter home from <hi>Putney,</hi> I came in, and this was in the beginning of <hi>May,</hi> in a diſguiſe; and he ſays he ſaw me a ſecond time in another diſguiſe. Then comes a third Witneſs that I called, and that is <hi>Page,</hi> and he came into the Hall, where the Patients uſe to wait for his Maſter, and there he met me, and ſpoke with me. Then I called <hi>Walker,</hi> the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, but it happens his Memory is not ſo good now, as it was heretofore, and indeed I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell how to blame him; for 'tis ſo long ſince, that it is impoſſible for any body to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the Circumſtances of times and places, that in ſome ſhort time after the Fact, might have been remembred with far greater Eaſe. I expected Sir <hi>Richard Barker</hi> might have been here, being Subpoened to Juſtifie the Evidence of theſe people; and I did expect that Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> would have been examined; but I perceived the Court tender of that point, as knowing it would then eaſily have been ſeen upon which ſide it was, that he was ſuborn'd, that is, to make ſuch a Confeſſion as Mr. <hi>Attorney</hi> would have hinted at.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Oates.</speaker>
               <p>But, my Lord, this I ſay, The Evidence upon which I am now indicted of Perju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is the ſame, which was delivered ſix years ago at the <hi>Old Baily,</hi> at <hi>Whitebread</hi>'s Trial firſt, and then at <hi>Langhorn</hi>'s Trial, where were ſixteen Witneſſes then produced and heard againſt me: But then, my Lord, what Credit did they receive at <hi>Whitebread</hi> and <hi>Lang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn</hi>'s Trials? Now if this Evidence that I gave was then to be beleived, tho oppoſed by ſo many Witneſſes, what new objection does riſe againſt it, which was not then hinted and received an anſwer? For as to all the Records that are brought out of the Houſe of Lords, they have not amounted to a Charge ſufficient to diminiſh any mans Evidence in the world; for as to the Narrative that is entred there in the Journal; I think I and any man elſe, that were concerned as I was, may very well defend the truth of it; and I do avow the truth of the Popiſh Plot, and will ſtand by it as long as I have a day to live, and I do not queſtion but the Jury upon Conſideration of thoſe Proteſtant Witneſſes, that I have here brought againſt theſe Popiſh Seminaries, will, acquit me of this Perjury. I leave it to your Lordſhip and the Jury to judge, and I hope thoſe paſſages of heat, that have fallen from me in Court ſhall not make me fare at all the worſe in your Judgement. I have called ſome Noble Lords to teſtify for me; but I find, either the diſtance of time has wrought upon their memories, or the difference of the ſeaſon has chang'd their opinion, ſo that now they disbelieve that, which they did believe before, and perhaps for as little Reaſon as—</p>

               <speaker>Oates.</speaker>
               <p>Yes truely, my Lord, for as little reaſon as they believed me at firſt; For I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not expect that a man, who believes without a principal ſhould not recant that belief with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a reaſon.</p>

               <p>Good Mr. Juſtice <hi>Walcot,</hi> was there ever any man dealt with as I am, or had ſuch Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence offered to be given againſt him? Here they offer to blacken me with the Imputation of that foul, infamous Crime of Perjury; and who are the Witneſſes to prove it, but Youths out of a Seminary; Sir <hi>George Wakeman,</hi> and my Lord <hi>Caſtlemain,</hi> known Papiſts, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps Popiſh Recuſants, Convict too; as for my Lord <hi>Caſtlemain,</hi> the Record of his acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal is brought as a Charge againſt me, to prove that I was forſworn; and not believed at his Tryal; when all the World knows, it was becauſe there was but one Witneſs againſt him that he came of, and that was the Reaſon that was urged by my Lord C. Juſtice <hi>Soroggs</hi> at that very time, who would not admit <hi>Dangerfield</hi> to be a Witneſs, and reflected not at all upon my Teſtimony, but directed the Jury, for want of another Witneſs, to acquit him: Then my Lord, here is <hi>Wakeman</hi> brought and his acquital too; he ſwears all I ſaid againſt him was falſe; whereas, had it not been for two diſhoneſt perſons, one I have now in my ſight; I ſhall not name any names; we could at that time have proved five thouſand pound of the money paid to him, and that he gave a Receipt for it; but my Lord, this I am ſure of, if I had been brought in as a Witneſs in the Caſe of thoſe that ſuffered lately for the Presbyterian Phanatick Plot (as they call it) I had never been call'd in queſtion, if my Evidence had been falſe; but it is apparent the Papiſts have now a Turn to ſerve, and theſe Papiſts are brought in, the St. <hi>Omers</hi> Youths, to bear this Teſtimony, on purpoſe to falſify my Evidence, and to bring of the Popiſh Lords, that now ſtand impeach'd of high Treaſon for the Popiſh Conſpiracy; but, my Lord, I hope as the Court would never admit indictments of Perjury againſt the Witneſſes in that Caſe of my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> ſo you will not admit it here; and if my L. C. Juſtice <hi>Jones</hi> were in the Right, who did the ſame thing in his Circuit, I hope I ſhall have that Right done me here. My Lord, it is not me they indict, but the whole Proteſtant Intereſt is aim'd at in this Proſecution; and hereby they arraign the whole proceedings of ſo many Parliaments, all the Courts of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and the Verdicts of thoſe Juries, that convicted the Traytors that were executed; for my own part I care not what becomes of me, the Truth will one time or another appear.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>And that they ſeperated themſelves into leſſer Companies and Clubs, and that the Jeſuits came to a reſolution to murder the late King, and that he, the Defendant, <hi>Oates,</hi> carried this reſolution from Chamber to Chamber, and ſaw it ſigned by them; now all this is laid in his Indictment to be falſe; for that in truth, he was not preſent at any ſuch Conſult of the Jeſuits at the White-Horſe-Tavern in the <hi>Strand</hi> upon the twenty fourth of <hi>April,</hi> 78. nor did carry any ſuch reſolution from Chamber to Chamber to be ſign'd as he had ſworn in the <hi>Old Baily</hi> at that Trial, and ſo has committed Wilful and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Perjury.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, the Evidence, that has been given to prove, that he was not preſent at any ſuch Conſult, nor did carry any ſuch Reſolution, has been by proving where he was at that very time, that he ſwears this Conſult was held, that is, that he was really at St. <hi>Omers,</hi> in parts beyond the Seas, and not in <hi>London;</hi> and to make out this, we have produced no leſs then twenty Wineſſes, that ſwear poſitively, and give you very many Circumſtances to induce you to believe, that what they have taken upon them to remember is really and effectually true.</p>
               <p>Firſt, you have Mr. <hi>Hilſley,</hi> and he ſwears that he himſelf came away from St. <hi>Omers,</hi> the twenty fourth of <hi>April,</hi> New Stile, which is the fourteenth of <hi>April,</hi> Old Stile, which was a Sunday; that night he came to <hi>Callis,</hi> the next day he arriv'd at <hi>Dover,</hi> and coming up to Town towards <hi>London,</hi> the next day he met with Mr. <hi>Bournaby,</hi> who was then going to St. <hi>Omers.</hi> And he further ſwears, that at that very time, when he came from St. <hi>Omers,</hi> he left <hi>Oates,</hi> the Defendant, upon the place; this I ſay was the fourteenth of <hi>April:</hi> And for a Confirmation of this to be true, he left him there at that time. I would mention what two other Witneſſes do teſtify, and therein do verify what he ſwears; for they tell you, That at this very time when he came over, or within a day or two, but long before ſuch time as there was any occaſion to bring this to be a queſtion, he told one of them, in a diſcourſe that was between them, that he had left upon the place from whence he came, which was the College at St. <hi>Omers,</hi> an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Miniſter, whoſe name was <hi>Sampſon Lucy.</hi>—</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Oates,</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I beg I may have leave to withdraw, for I am very weak, and Ill.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. Juſtice.</speaker>
               <p>Then make Room for him to go away, if he will.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Soll. Gen.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>And they give you an account, that the Defendant, <hi>Oates,</hi> went by that name there, and it is not denyed by him that he did ſo: And this is a Circumſtance greatly verifying Mr. <hi>Hilſley's</hi> Evidence. Then comes Mr. <hi>Bournaby,</hi> who ſears, That he met Mr. <hi>Hilſley</hi> when he came from St. <hi>Omers,</hi> about the ſixteenth of <hi>April,</hi> O. S. and the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty firſt of <hi>April,</hi> O. S. he came to St. <hi>Omers;</hi> and that when he came there he found <hi>Oates</hi> there upon the place, this was the firſt of <hi>May,</hi> New Stile, and he gives you this circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to ſtrengthen his Teſtimony, That he very well remembers, that upon the ſecond of May, N. S. the day after he came to St. <hi>Omers, Oates</hi> intruded into his Company and got himſelf acquainted with him; he ſays further, that upon the third of <hi>May,</hi> N. S. he par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly remembers <hi>Oates</hi> was in his Company there, and they went into the Garden and walkt together; he alſo ſays, he ſaw him the fifth of <hi>May,</hi> N. S. which is the twenty fifth of <hi>April,</hi> O. S. the day after this day aſſigned for the Conſult, with this Circumſtance, That he remembers to have ſeen him in the Rhetorick School, and ſo ſucceſſively afterwards he gives you a particular account down to <hi>Midſummer;</hi> after that <hi>Oates</hi> continued in the College at <hi>St. Omers,</hi> and then went away.</p>
               <p>Then the next Witneſs we produce is Mr. <hi>Pool,</hi> and he gives you an Account, That upon
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:102575:42"/>the twenty fifth of <hi>April,</hi> 1678. N. S. which was the fifteenth of <hi>April,</hi> Our Stile, he came over here, and he left behind him at St. <hi>Omers,</hi> the Defendant <hi>Oates;</hi> for he particularly remembers, that he ſaw him there when he came away; ſo <hi>Hilſley</hi> left him the fourteenth of <hi>April;</hi> Mr. <hi>Pool</hi> came away the fifteenth of <hi>April,</hi> which is our twenty fifth, and left him at St. <hi>Omers,</hi> and does not remember, That he uſed to be abſent out of the College; and Mr. <hi>Bournaby</hi> finds him there the twenty firſt of <hi>April;</hi> ſo that particularly at the times, the other two came away, and <hi>Bournaby</hi> came thither, there he was, and there they ſaw him.</p>
               <p>The next Witneſs is Mr. <hi>Thornton,</hi> and he gives you an account when <hi>Oates</hi> came thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther firſt, and how long he ſtayed there; he ſays he came about <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> 77. and there he ſtay'd till <hi>Midſummer</hi>-Eve, 78; and he tells you ſome particular days he ſaw him on; he ſays he ſaw him there on the firſt of <hi>May,</hi> N. S. and he ſaw him the ſecond of <hi>May,</hi> N. S. in Company with Mr. <hi>Bournaby,</hi> the next day after his Arrival there, wondring at their ſuddain acquaintance. And he adds a particular Circumſtance, why he remembers it was the ſecond of <hi>May;</hi> becauſe that day the Scholars at St. <hi>Omers,</hi> acted a Play, at which <hi>Oates</hi> had a Skuffle for a Seat; and he ſays he does likewiſe remember him to have been there, when Mr. <hi>Pool</hi> came away, which was the twenty fifth of <hi>April,</hi> N. S.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Conway,</hi> that was our next Witneſs, gives you an account likewiſe of <hi>Oates</hi>'s coming to St. <hi>Omers</hi> about <hi>December,</hi> 77. and how long he ſtayed there, <hi>viz.</hi> till the latter end of <hi>June,</hi> 78. And he does not remember, that he lay out of the College above one Night, and that was in <hi>January.</hi> And he remembers particularly, that he ſaw him with Mr. <hi>Bournaby</hi> ſuch a day in <hi>May.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then we brought another Witneſs, and that was Mr. <hi>Haggerstone,</hi> and he tells you, he had good reaſon to remember Mr. <hi>Oates,</hi> for he was in the ſame <hi>Claſſis</hi> with him; and this Gentleman gives an account particularly, that he remembers him to be there the next day after Mr. <hi>Bournaby</hi> came, and agrees in Teſtimony with all the reſt, that from <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> till <hi>Midſummer,</hi> he was not abſent out of the College, but one night.</p>
               <p>We have another Witneſs, Mr. <hi>Beeston,</hi> and he remembers, that <hi>Oates</hi> was playing at Nine-pins the firſt of <hi>May;</hi> he remembers the ſecond of <hi>May</hi> to have ſeen him with Mr. <hi>Bournaby</hi> after the play was over; and that agrees with the other Witneſſes about his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>Bournaby</hi>'s Company the Second of <hi>May;</hi> and he remembers likewiſe, that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was choſen Reader to the Sodality; but upon Mr. <hi>Oates</hi>'s Importunity, he ſupplyed the place in Mr. <hi>Beeſton</hi>'s Room, onely with this Reſerve and Condition, That Mr. <hi>Beeſton</hi> was to be Reader at any time, if <hi>Oates</hi> failed; and he gives you this particular account, that <hi>Oates</hi> did read, as he believes, every Sunday and Holiday, from the latter end of <hi>March,</hi> when he was choſen Reader, to within a Week of his going away; for that he did never read himſelf as he ſhould have done, if <hi>Oates</hi> had been abſent or failed to read.</p>
               <p>We have another Witneſs, and that is Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> and he ſwears his being there from <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> 77 to <hi>Midſummer,</hi> 78. and he remembers particularly as to <hi>April</hi> and <hi>May,</hi> becauſe the twenty firſt of <hi>April,</hi> he himſelf fell ſick in the College, and went into the Infirmary, and remained there till the ſeventh of <hi>May;</hi> and he does remember that <hi>Oates</hi> viſited him very oft in that time in the Infirmary, and told him Mr. <hi>Hilſley</hi> was gone away, and Mr. <hi>Pool</hi> was gone away, and two or three other particulars, which happened in the College at that time; ſo that there is another Evidence, that is very ſtrong with Circumſtances to confirm the Teſtimony of the reſt; and he gives you a very ſatisfactory account of it, by ſhowing the reaſons how he comes to remember theſe things.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Price,</hi> who was our next Witneſs, has given you a Relation all to the ſame purpoſe of <hi>Oates</hi>'s coming there at <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> and of his going away at <hi>Midſummer.</hi> And he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members particularly, that <hi>Oates</hi> was at St. <hi>Omers,</hi> when the Jeſuits went to the Conſult at <hi>London;</hi> for that there was a Conſult, and at that time, is acknowledged to be true; but not ſuch as he ſays, nor was he there; but he ſays ſome of the Fathers did call there in the way to <hi>England.</hi> And at that very time, and after, he ſaw him there. And Mr. <hi>Dod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dington</hi> gives you the ſame account.</p>
               <p>Then comes Mr. <hi>Gerrard,</hi> and he tells you a Story to the ſame purpoſe; how long <hi>Oates</hi> was there, and when he came. And that the Second of <hi>May</hi> he remembers <hi>Oates</hi> was at the Play; and he remembers the twenty ſixth of <hi>May, Oates</hi> was there, which was the ſixteenth of <hi>May,</hi> O. S. And he is ſure <hi>Oates</hi> was there at that time, for this reaſon, that being the day whereon he himſelf was confirmed, St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi>'s day; and <hi>Oates</hi> was confirm'd with him; and therefore he has reaſon to Remember <hi>Oates</hi> was at St. <hi>Omers.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:102575:42"/>
               <p>My Lord <hi>Gerrard</hi> of <hi>Bromeley</hi> was our next witneſs, and he gives you an account to the ſame purpoſe; and to the General Evidence, in which he confirm, the others, he adds this particular, That <hi>Oates</hi> uſed to read with a ſingular Canting Tone; ſo that he muſt needs remember him, and was ſo remarkable for other things that he could not be abſent without being miſſed, which he never was.</p>
               <p>Then comes Mr. <hi>Morgan,</hi> who was there at that time, a Scholar; but he's now a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> and therefore not liable to Mr. <hi>Oates</hi>'s great Exception of Religion; he confirms what all the witneſſes ſaid of the time of <hi>Oates</hi>'s coming, and of the time of his going away: And particularly he ſwears, That when Mr. <hi>Hilſley</hi> went away, he was there; when Mr. <hi>Pool</hi> went away, he was there; and when Mr. <hi>Bournaby</hi> came thither, he was there. And this is not all; for there is ſomewhat more remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in his Teſtimony; for he tells you particularly he does remember, That upon the twenty fourth of <hi>April,</hi> O. S. the Day, Gentlemen, when <hi>Oates</hi> ſays he was at the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult in <hi>London, Oates</hi> was then at St. <hi>Omers.</hi> And the occaſion of his remembring this, he gives you an account of; for, he tells you, upon reading the Trial of <hi>Ireland,</hi> where <hi>Oates</hi> ſwears, That he was here at the Conſult the twenty fourth of <hi>April,</hi> 1678, O. S. all the College reflected upon it, and wondred at the Impudence of the man, that he ſhould dare to ſwear ſuch a thing, when all the College remembred him to be there all the while: And upon recollection of Circumſtances he himſelf did particularly recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect his own playing at Ball that very day, and having toſt his Ball over the wall, he bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed <hi>Oates</hi>'s Key to go into the Garden to fetch it: And this was thought of whilſt things were freſh, and every man Remembred this, or that, or the other thing to be done at ſuch a particular time.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Arundel,</hi> who was another witneſs, proves the general Teſtimony of the reſt, and agrees in ſome particular things; and all he ſays, is to the ſame purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Chriſtopher Tubervile,</hi> he comes and ſwears <hi>Oates</hi>'s being at St. <hi>Omers</hi> the fourth or fifth of <hi>May,</hi> which is the twenty fourth and twenty fifth of <hi>April,</hi> Old Stile. For that upon Mr. <hi>Pool</hi>'s going away, he changed his Chamber in the College, and ſaw <hi>Oates</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers days afterwards in his Chamber, and at the Door; and he knew that he conſtantly read in the Sodality, and that he left particularly the Sunday before he went away; which was about <hi>Midſummer,</hi> 1678.</p>
               <p>There was another Gentleman, and that was Mr. <hi>Anthony Turbervile,</hi> who gives Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence all to the ſame purpoſe; and this Circumſtance goes thorough all the Teſtimony of theſe Perſons, that there's ſcare any body can come to, or go out of the College, but it is known to all that are there, every man takes notice of it, 'tis the Common Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe amongſt them; and therefore they give this as the Reaſon of their Belief, That he was there all this while, becauſe they did not remember any thing that ſhould give them occaſion to believe Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> was away from the College from <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> till <hi>Midſummer,</hi> but only one time; and the remembrance of that does ſhow, That they do really obſerve theſe things; for they could all tell that in <hi>January</hi> he went to <hi>Watton,</hi> and ſtayed out one Night.</p>
               <p>There is one witneſs more that is poſitive and particular, and that is Mr. <hi>Clavering,</hi> and he remembers <hi>Oates,</hi> by a very remarkable Circumſtance, was at St. <hi>Omers</hi> at the very time the Congregation is ſaid to be held in <hi>London;</hi> for he tells you there came a Perſon to beg money of him, and there was a Collection made in the Houſe; and this Perſon did deſire to ſpeak with <hi>Oates,</hi> who was then in the College; and whom it ſeems this Perſon had known in <hi>Spain;</hi> but <hi>Oates</hi> did refuſe to ſpeak with him, and did not come down to him. Thus he remembers ſuch an one came there, and when he was there, he was ſent to <hi>Oates</hi> to deſire him to come down to this man, and he would not. Ay but now how is this remembred to be at the time when the Congregation was held here in <hi>England?</hi> As to that, he gives this plain and full account, That it muſt be at that very time; for the Scholars did diſcourſe among themſelves, and were reckoning up what he had gotten among them, and what he had gotten at <hi>Watton:</hi> and finding that it was very inconſiderable that he had gotten at <hi>Watton,</hi> they talkt among themſelves what ſhould be the Reaſon, and concluded it was, becauſe the Fathers were gone over to <hi>England</hi> to the Congregation.</p>
               <p>Theſe particular Circumſtances our witneſſes give you as the Reaſons of their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Remembrances of the particular times: But, Gentlemen, you muſt take along with you thoſe General Conſiderations too that are offered, which do affect the whole time, from <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> till <hi>Midſummer.</hi> Firſt, That none can come or go, without being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed of in the College: Next, That much more Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> muſt needs be miſſed, than
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:102575:43"/>any other, being ſo Remarkable a Perſon, as they tell you, that ſcarce any week paſt without his making it remarkable by ſome ridiculous Action or another. They ſay he ſate ſingly by himſelf, at a particular Table, that no man could come into the Hall, but they muſt ſee him; and therefore if abſent, muſt needs miſs him. And yet they ſwear they do not ever remember him abſent, but that one Night; and if he had been abſent, they muſt needs have obſerved it, becauſe of all thoſe Circumſtances that have been recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned up.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the witneſſes, Gentlemen, that we have produced to prove this Charge upon the Defendant, two of whom are brought only to verifie Mr. <hi>Hilſley</hi>'s Teſtimony; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving heard it from him at that time that he had left <hi>Oates</hi> at St. <hi>Omers;</hi> when there was no thoughts of this Queſtion.</p>
               <p>Now among theſe twenty witneſſes, there are not above two or three at moſt that were at either of the Trials before. They were never produced as Evidence, though indeed they proved the ſame thing that was teſtified by others then; but with many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Circumſtances and Particularities that were not before ſpoken of; ſome are now produced that were produced before, and the reaſon is, becauſe they are themſelves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in thoſe particularities which gave occaſion to the others to remember them.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, after the producing of ſo many witneſſes, and ſo ſtrong a proof; what is it that Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> has produced againſt it? His main Objection to their Teſtimony, is, There were ſeveral that came from St. <hi>Omers</hi> to teſtifie at thoſe former Trials, what theſe now ſwear, who were not believed, but I was believed, and the men were Convicted, Condemned and Executed upon my Teſtimony: But is that all he has to ſay? No, ſays he, I have likewiſe witneſſes to offer as a Counter proof to them, a poſitive proof that I was here in <hi>England</hi> at the time they ſwear me to be at St. <hi>Omers;</hi> and he ſays well; if that be proved, there is an end of the Caſe. Well, what is the proof? the witneſſes that he has have been theſe four, <hi>Ciceley Mayo,</hi> ſervant to Sir <hi>Richard Barker, Butler,</hi> his Coachman, <hi>Page,</hi> another of Sir <hi>Richard</hi>'s Servants, and the Parſon <hi>Walker.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Evidence of <hi>Page</hi> and <hi>Walker,</hi> though produced laſt by Mr. <hi>Oates,</hi> yet I crave leave to mention firſt, and ſet them out of the way. <hi>Page</hi> he remembers to have ſeen Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> in a Diſguiſe at Sir <hi>Richard Barker</hi>'s; that is in Grey Cloths; but he is not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain as to the time, and he cannot take upon him to ſay, what time of the year, or what year it was, only he believes it was in <hi>May;</hi> and therefore that can be no ſufficient Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to contradict witneſſes, that with great particularity ſpeak to certain times. As for <hi>Walker,</hi> the Parſon, he ſaid he ſaw him between St <hi>Martin</hi>'s Lane and <hi>Leiceſter</hi> Fields; but he cannot remember the time when neither: Nay, the remembrance he has of it goes rather to another time, than the time in queſtion; for being asked what Circumſtance he knew the time by, he ſaid, it was about a year and a quarter before the Plot was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, which muſt be in <hi>April</hi> or <hi>May,</hi> 1677. and that will do the Doctor no Service at all upon this Queſtion.</p>
               <p>Now let us conſider Mrs. <hi>Mayo</hi>'s Teſtimony; and the Oath that ſhe made was this, That when <hi>Oates</hi> came over into <hi>England,</hi> ſhe ſaw him at Sir <hi>Richard Barker</hi>'s Houſe the latter end of <hi>April,</hi> or the beginning of <hi>May,</hi> and the week before <hi>Whitſontide;</hi> the latter end of <hi>April,</hi> or the beginning of <hi>May,</hi> was the firſt time that he came, that ſhe faw him; but that he came before, as ſhe heard, but the Coachman only ſaw him, and told her that <hi>Oates</hi> had been there; but the ſecond time ſhe did ſee him, and he went in and dined there in the Houſe: Sir <hi>Richard Barker</hi> was not there, but my Lady's Siſter, her Sons and Daughters were there; ſhe ſays, that ſhe ſaw him again a week before <hi>Whitſontide;</hi> that when he came the firſt time, he was in grey Cloths, a white Hat, and a ſhort Periwig: Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards he was in black Cloths, a pretty long Periwig, not very long, but the Periwig was brown; and theſe are the Circumſtances ſhe remembers to have ſeen him by.</p>
               <p>Now let us ſee what <hi>Butler,</hi> the Coachman, ſays, he remembers about the beginning of <hi>May</hi> he ſaw <hi>Oates</hi> at his Maſter's Houſe in a Diſguiſe; the other ſaid it was the latter end of <hi>April,</hi> or the beginning of <hi>May:</hi> But I ſtand not upon that; but this he does ſwear, That the firſt time he ſaw him, <hi>Ciceley Mayo</hi> ſaw him too, that he was then in grey Cloths, a white Hat, but his hair was cut ſhort, and he had no Periwig on; afterwards he came in a cinnamon coloured Coat, and green Ribbons, and a long black Periwig: This is <hi>Butler</hi>'s Evidence.</p>
               <p>Now theſe two People's Evidence are utterly impoſſible to be reconciled, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict one another ſo much: Firſt, They contradict one another in this; ſhe ſays, The firſt time he came, ſhe did not ſee him, but the Coachman told her, he had been there; but he ſwears, That ſhe did at that time look out of the Window into the Yard, and did
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:102575:43"/>ſee him as well as he: Another Contradiction is this, She remembers the firſt time he came in grey Cloths, a white Hat, and a ſhort Periwig; the Coachman he ſwears he had no Periwig on, but his hair was cut ſhort to his Ears: Then again ſhe ſwears the ſecond time, he was in black Cloths, and an indifferent long Periwig, and the Periwig was brown; and the other ſwears he was in cinnamon colour Cloths, and a long Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wig, and it was a black one. Now thus you ſee the witneſſes contradict themſelves, and cannot be reconciled to one another.</p>
               <p>But take one thing more, which is very conſiderable, wherein ſhe contradicts Mr. <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rard;</hi> for ſhe ſwears he was here a week before <hi>Whitſontide,</hi> that ſhe is ſure of: Now that falls upon the nineteenth day of <hi>May;</hi> then upon the ſixteenth day of <hi>May,</hi> was the week before <hi>Whitſontide;</hi> now, that is a moſt Eminent Day, by the Teſtimony of Mr. <hi>Gerrard;</hi> for that happens to be the twenty ſixth of <hi>May,</hi> New Stile, and that was the day he was confirmed with Mr. <hi>Gerrard</hi> at St. <hi>Omers:</hi> And no man ſure can doubt, which of the two witneſſes is to be believed; and it cannot but be true, that he was there at that time; becauſe ſo remarkable a Circumſtance cannot be forgotten; and yet this Woman ſwears that he was here a week before <hi>Whitſontide,</hi> and that by Computati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on muſt be the time of his Confirmation: But, Gentlemen, another thing that I offer upon the Teſtimony of theſe witneſſes, is this; If you will believe it, he himſelf contradicts his own witneſſes, or they him, and one of them is forſworn: For he has ſworn the Conſult was the twenty fourth of <hi>April,</hi> and that three or four days after that was over, he went back with the Fathers to St. <hi>Omers:</hi> Now, this contradicts all that his witneſſes have ſaid: But he has given himſelf, as he thought, ſome little latitude; ſays he, the Conſult began the twenty fourth, but it held ſix or ſeven dayes longer. We will for this time admit it to be ſo, and give him the ſix days he requires; and yet after all, it will not come up to the time that his witneſſes ſpeak to; for to the twenty fourth of <hi>April,</hi> add ſix days, and that brings us juſt to the laſt day of <hi>April;</hi> and then take four days in <hi>May,</hi> to make up the three or four days after the Conſult was over, and we are yet at a great diſtance from the <hi>Whitſon</hi> week; for that was the nineteenth of <hi>May,</hi> and the week before muſt be the twelfth or thirteenth, and ſo it is impoſſible to be reconciled to Truth, what he and his witneſſes ſwear; either the Evidence that the Doctor now brings, muſt be a Contradiction to his own former Oath, or his Oath proves they are miſtaken; beſides the Contradiction that is between the witneſſes themſelves; for they vary in a great many material Circumſtances, which I have before reckoned up to you.</p>
               <p>But, Gentlemen, falſe witneſſes are very often detected by little Circumſtances, though I muſt needs ſay theſe are not ſmall ones; for theſe are very remarkable things in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and great Contradictions to one another, and therefore 'tis impoſſible they both can ſwear true.</p>
               <p>There were ſome other witneſſes that were produced by Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> formerly upon this point; one of which was <hi>Clay,</hi> the Prieſt, and he you hear is contradicted by Mr. <hi>Howard</hi>'s Teſtimony, who not only tells you he was not at his Houſe, when he ſays he was; but ſhews that <hi>Clay</hi> was miſtaken in point of time: It was not in <hi>May,</hi> but in <hi>July:</hi> But that's not all, we have another Evidence, Gentlemen, to ſhow how this miſtake comes to paſs, and which will give a great light into this ſort of practice that has been uſed in this matter; for we have two witneſſes that give you an account how <hi>Oates</hi> and Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> were at the <hi>Gate-houſe</hi> with <hi>Clay,</hi> and there did threaten him, That unleſs he ſwore he dined with <hi>Oates</hi> at Mr. <hi>Howard</hi>'s in <hi>May,</hi> they knew he was a Prieſt, and he ſhould be hanged: The man was ſomewhat cautious at firſt, for truly he knew nothing of the matter, but at laſt, upon condition he might have his money again that was taken from him; he had been a Rogue formerly, and he did not know what he might do. Now, we find preſently after, that he was in fact brought as a witneſs; what he ſwore, Mr. <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> tells you, and you have heard him contradicted in that point of time. For Mr. <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> ſays, it was in <hi>July;</hi> and then it was agreed, that <hi>Oates</hi> was in <hi>England;</hi> for our witneſſes tell you, that at <hi>Midſummer</hi> he came away from St. <hi>Omers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that, Gentlemen, the Evidence that was formerly produced for him, is not only taken away by poſitive Counter-proof, but there is fixt upon him, with great Infamy, the additional Crime of Subornation, by forcing People to ſwear for him under the Threats of being hanged; and we all know how ſuch People lay under great fears and terrors at that time.</p>
               <p>There was another witneſs that was produced formerly for him; but I ſhall not take upon me to repeat all the particular Evidence that has been now given about that
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:102575:44"/>matter: In ſhort, our Objection to that Teſtimony lies thus; That <hi>Oates</hi> did ſwear in his Narrative, that <hi>Smith</hi> was a dangerous man, and imployed by the Jeſuits to ſtir up the People againſt the Government; that appears by <hi>Oates</hi> his own Oath. But it like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe appears, that afterwards they were reconciled, and that he gave <hi>Smith</hi> a Certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate under his hand, that he was a good Proteſtant, and a good Subject, and about Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Service for the King: Now, we ſee no reaſon hitherto, why Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> ſhould change his mind, after having ſworn him ſuch an ill man, all of a ſuddain to be ſo kind to give him his Protection, and ſo advantageous a Character, as that was in that Seaſon. But, Gentlemen, the myſtery is eaſily unfolded, if we go three or four days further in time, which brings us to the Trials of <hi>Whitebread</hi> and <hi>Langhorn;</hi> it ſeems Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> was then aware of that, which is now an Objection to his Teſtimony; for it was made an Objection at the firſt Trial of <hi>Ireland,</hi> That he was not at this Conſult, for he was then actually at St. <hi>Omers;</hi> but no witneſſes were there to prove it; but now he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware that ſome were a coming over, and it concerned him to make ſome good proof if he could, that really and in truth he was here in <hi>London</hi> at that time.</p>
               <p>And I cannot omit to take notice of what my <hi>Lord Chief Juſtice</hi> was pleaſed to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve and object to him now; It is a wonder a man ſhould be here in Town ſo long; a man that had much Acquaintance, as it ſeems he had, a man that went about freely and publickly, as his own witneſſes ſay he did, ſhould be ſeen by no body, but theſe few, ſhould not be able to give an account, by any body, where he lodged, at any one time in this Interval. Nay, by no Circumſtances that muſt occur to his own Knowledge, to be able to ſhew where he lodged, is very ſtrange; though it ſhould be that he did lodge in the Houſes of thoſe that would not come to give Evidence, as he alleadges, yet it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt impoſſible, but there muſt be ſome other Circumſtances to prove his being here, beſides the Evidence of the Landlord of the Houſe where he lodged; but he gives no account where he was lodged, and whom he converſed withal, but theſe People only; and that they ſhould ſee him, who were not his Intimates, and none elſe in the World, is to me one of the moſt ſtrange things that can be conceived.</p>
               <p>Now Gentlemen, when he has given no manner of ſatisfaction, that he was here, and is by twenty witneſſes ſworn not to be here; What is it that he ſays to all this? why, he doth inſiſt upon it, that his Credit muſt not be now Impeached, becauſe that once he had the fortune to be believed, and ſome men have died and ſuffered for it; as if no Perjury were to be puniſhed, but that which is unſucceſsful; whereas the reaſon why Perjury is taken notice of in the Temporal Courts, is only becauſe of the miſchief that it may do: Shall it then be no Crime when a man has done the miſchief, when the fear of that miſchief was the ground of making it a Crime? that is a moſt monſtrous way of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing. And yet this would Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> have look like an Argument, that becauſe he has been believed in his falſe Oaths, and men have ſuffered by his Perjury, and he has been ſucceſsful in his Crime, that Succeſs has protected his wickedneſs from puniſhment. This I confeſs is a new way of arguing; and ſuch as none but Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> could certainly have invented.</p>
               <p>But, Gentlemen, to contradict this, we have ſhown you, that as he has had the fortune to be believed; ſo he has likewiſe had the fortune to be disbelieved. For there has been produced as many Records of Acquitals, where he was an Evidence, as there have been produced Convictions upon his Teſtimony; ſo that he has been as often disbelived as believed.</p>
               <p>Whither then does he betake himſelf next? he has called a great many witneſſes to give you, as Evidence for him, an account what Opinions at that time the Houſes of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, the Courts of Juſtice, and the Juries had of his Evidence; and then inſiſts upon it, that now to call his Credit in queſtion, is to arraign the Juſtice of the Nation, the Wiſdom of both Plouſes of Parliament that believed him, the Honeſty of the Juries that convicted thoſe whom he accuſed, and the Integrity and Underſtanding of the Judges who were Learned, Wife and Juſt men; and with great earneſtneſs he asks the queſtion; Why now at this time of day ſhould this be called in queſtion, which received ſo much Credit and Approbation ſo long ago, by the good opinion that all forts of men had of it at that time? And, Now to queſtion this, he would have thought to be a caſting a Blot upon the Wiſdom of the Nation, and an arraigning the Juſtice of it; when, if the thing be duly conſidered, the not puniſhing this hainous offence with the utmoſt ſeverity that the Law will allow of, now, that theſe Circumſtances appear to make it plain and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, would be a greater piece of Injuſtice and Reproach rather to our Nation, than any ways a Reflection on the Juſtice of it.</p>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:102575:44"/>
               <p>Gentlemen, when we conſider the Circumſtances of this Caſe now I do verily think it will appear to be a very ſtrange and wonderful thing to us, that ever any man ſhould have believed him. And it is a ſtrange Conſideration to reflect upon, to think what Credit he had at that time. But withal conſider, Gentlemen, could any one imagine, that it were poſſible for any man on Earth to become ſo impudent as to dare to expoſe himſelf before the High Court of Parliament, the great Courts of Juſtice, and there tell a moſt Infamous Lye for the taking away the Lives of men? the greatneſs of the Attempt was a great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement to the belief of it, becauſe no man could be preſumed to dare the doing of ſuch a thing, if he had not a Foundation of truth to build upon. And when he had thus made his diſcovery, and that of ſuch a nature too, a moſt horrid, bloody and traiterous Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to murder the King, to overturn the Government, to maſſacre all the Proteſtants in the Kingdom, and to deface the very name of the Proteſtant Religion. What was more natural than that the Parliament ſhould take all imaginable care to prevent the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſo great a miſchief. And conſider too how much eaſier it was for him to relate his Evidence in a continued Story, than afterwards it was to maintain it, when it came to be examined and oppoſed by them that were accuſed, who beſt knew wherein, and by what means to prove him falſe.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, the Care the Parliament took to diſappoint any deſigns of this nature, and the means they uſed for the ſecurity of the King and Kingdom, and the Preſervation of our Religion and Lives, (which I cannot but obſerve was praevious to the Trial of any one Offender, that was tryed and convicted upon this Evidence) muſt needs put the whole Nation under great apprechenſions of danger, and make the way much eaſier for him to be believed, as by ſad experience we found it did. Under theſe circumſtances came thoſe men to be tryed, with this further (as we cannot now but think) that there were ill men at work, that laboured to improve thoſe fears and Jealouſies, that had already poſſeſt mens minds; the wonder then will be the leſs, if men under ſuch diſadvantages, tryed by men under thoſe fears and apprehenſions, had the ill Fortune to be convicted. But when men had a little overcome their fears, and began to conſider his Evidence more calmly, the ſcene was changed, <hi>Oates</hi> loſt his Credit, and the men were all acquitted. Nor is this Proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion any reflection on the Proteſtant Religion, whoſe cauſe he falſty aſſumes to himſelf. No, Gentlemen, the Proteſtant Religion had no ſhare in that invention. It needs not the ſupport of a Lye, no not the moſt plauſible Lye, much leſs of one ſo Infamous as this does now appear to be. It is rather a Vindication of our Religion to puniſh ſuch Offenders as they deſerve, and the proper way to maintain the Juſtice of the Nation, and wipe off that reproach this mans Perjury has brought upon it.</p>

               <speaker>L. C. Juſtice.</speaker>
               <p>Then Gentlemen of the Jury, the Evidence has been very long, and it cannot be expected after ſo much time has been ſpent in this Cauſe, and ſuch a difference of teſtimony, and eſpecially conſidering that the teſtimony has met with frequent inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, and I may ſay ſome part of it delivered in great Confuſion, it cannot be thought or imagined, I ſay, that I ſhould be able to remind you of the ſeveral particulars that concern this Caſe, and may be neceſſary to be obſerved about it. But, Gentlemen, I am ſure by the Knowledge I have of the moſt of you, you are perſons of great Underſtanding; ſo that what may be omitted by me, I queſtion not, but your own abilities will ſupply; I confeſs I am much ſhortned in my Labour by the pains, that Mr. <hi>Sollicitor</hi> has taken to ſumm up the Evidence to you, and without all doubt has done it with all Faithfulneſs to his Maſter, and with great Right to himſelf. I could not hear much of what he did ſay; but you, who were nearer and did hear all, which I could not do, your Judgments will direct you to lay that weight upon it, which it deſerves, and which the Law will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; for Gentlemen I am bound to tell you, that you are to lay no weight upon any Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legations on the one ſide or on the other, or what is obſerved to you by the Court, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than is ſupported by the Teſtimony that has been offered.</p>
               <p>Now, Gentlemen, I think it not amiſs for me (before ſuch time, as I enter upon the Conſideration of the particulars, and reminding you what I take to be Evidence in this caſe, and what not) to clear one point, that this perſon <hi>Oates,</hi> the Defendant, againſt whom this Indictment of Perjury is brought, has endeavoured to inſinuate on purpoſe to gain him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a Reputation, which if he could acquire this way, would add a greater Reproach to the Juſtice of the Nation, than it has contracted already by giving too much Credit to ſuch Profligate Wretches, as have too lately appeared among us. The Objection he makes and inſiſts ſo much upon; ſays he, I was believed very much before, I can produce you the opinions of the Judges, that declared themſelves very well ſatisfied with my Evidence, and the Verdicts of Juries, two or three, that convicted men upon my Teſtimony; and
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:102575:45"/>rot only that, but here were likewiſe three or four Parliaments that did not only believe that Teſtimony, (or rather Narrative; for I cannot call that Teſtimony which was given before the Houſe of Commons) that I gave, but did declare their Satisfaction of the Truth of what I ſaid, which Satisfaction and Belief of theirs did produce thanks from both Houſes to me for giving this Teſtimony.</p>
               <p>But all this while, what Mr. <hi>Sollicitor</hi> ſaid upon this point, is a plain and a full anſwer to it: If in caſe upon a ſuddain information, the King, the Parliament, the Courts of Law, and Juries, were ſurprized into this Belief, as not imagining there could be a pack of ſuch Villains, that could be wound up to that height, as theſe Fellows have been; that there could be ſuch an horrid Impoſture, as this Fellow, that ſhould make ſuch attempts, unleſs there had been ſome truth in it.</p>
               <p>Therefore the ſurpriſe of the thing, at that time, might obtain a Belief; but, God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid, that that Belief which was ſo obtained, ſhould protect the Party believed from being called in queſtion for the falſhood of that Teſtimony, which was the ground of that Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief. It was hardly credible that any Perſon could be ſo wicked as to declare ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent falſities as theſe; but, God forbid, that we ſhould continue longer under the ſame blindneſs and deluſion, the whole matter is now laid open and detected. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, Gentlemen, if you are ſatisfied in your Conſciences, and do believe upon the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and Evidence that has been given here this day, that thoſe very things that were ſo much believed before, were credited upon the ſurpriſe of a ſuddain diſcovery, or the boldneſs of the undertaking, yet now do plainly appear to be falſe; then be it, I ſay, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your Conſciences, if you let this falſhood go unpuniſhed: It is a Charge upon us who are upon our Oaths as Judges, and who muſt anſwer to the great Judge of all the World for our Judgments; and 'tis likewiſe a Charge upon you that are ſworn to try this Cauſe, and muſt anſwer, as well as we, for what you do in it, not to have regard to any thing that was done before upon that hurry and ſurpriſe, but ſeriouſly to weigh and conſider what is ſworn now, and from thence to make a Concluſion, whether you are not ſatisfied that Innocent Blood has been ſpilt by the means of this Fellow: Nay, in this Caſe 'tis a contracting of much more Guilt than ordinary, as it is Murder done under the Forms of Law, and common Methods of Juſtice; that men ſhould take away the Lives of their Fellow Creatures, by Perjury and Falſe Accuſations, is of ſuch dreadful Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, that if the Juſtice of the Nation ſhall be afraid to have ſuch matters detected, there would be an end of all the Security we have of our Lives, Liberties, and whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is dear to us.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, the Juſtice of the Nation lies under a very great Reproach abroad; for this particular thing, and we muſt be, all of us, that have any Concern for the Honour and Good of our Country, uneaſie, till this matter be throughly ſearched into, and impartially determined; and I take it to be a Caſe of the greateſt Importance to the Settlement of the Kingdom, for the Credit of our Laws, for the Honour and Juſtice of our Kingdom, that ever came in Judgment in any of our Courts of Juſtice. And therefore as you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect your own Conſciences, and the Obligation of that Oath you are now under, and as you would be thought to bear any regard to the Peace, Honour and Good of your Country, take care to examine ſtrictly and impartially into the Merits of this Cauſe, and weigh the Evidence which has been given on all ſides: Be not at all diſmayed with the Apprehenſions of Clamour or Calumny, from any ſort of People whatſoever, for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your Duty; neither be led away by the Inſinuations of what was believed formerly; for you hear the reaſon which might make <hi>Oates</hi> be believed then; but it is incumbent upon you to enquire, whether you have not ſufficient reaſon to be ſatisfied what the truth now is.</p>
               <p>And, Gentlemen, I take my ſelf to be the more obliged to take ſome pains in the preſſing a ſerious and Impartial Conſideration of theſe things upon you, becauſe I cannot but ſay, my Blood does curdle, and my Spirits are raiſed, that after the Diſcoveries made, I think, to the ſatisfaction of all that has attended this Day, to ſee a Fellow con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſo Impudent, as to brazen it out, as he has done this Day; and that there ſhould appear no more Shame and Confuſion than what was ſeen in the face of that monſtrous Villain that ſtood but now at the Bar; the pretended Infirmiy of his Body made him remove out of Court, but the Infirmity of his depraved Mind, the Blackneſs of his Soul, the Baſeneſs of his Actions ought to be looked upon with ſuch Horror and Deteſtation, as to think him unworthy any longer to tread upon the Face of God's Earth: You'll pardon my warmth, I hope; for it is Impoſſible that ſuch things ſhould come before any honeſt man, and not have ſome extraordinary Influence upon him.</p>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:102575:45"/>
               <p>Gentlemen, as to the Merits of the Cauſe, you have the poſitive proof of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Witneſſes, whoſe Teſtimony, I ſhall by and by, as well as I can, repeat to you, but pray you firſt give me leave to obſerve ſomewhat, as to ſome points, that have been ſtarted at the Barr, as, Whether a Papiſt can be a Witneſs: Now ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe all theſe perſons, that come here to teſtify this matter againſt the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant were Papiſts, as they are not, except you can take it upon your Oaths and Conſciences, that all theſe men are guilty of voluntary and wilful Perjury, you muſt find the Defendant guilty.</p>
               <p>As to their difference in Religion, which <hi>Oates</hi> ſo much hung upon, I muſt tell you, every Papiſt or Roman Catholick, call them how you will, except the contrary be made appear by a Legal Exception; I mean ſuch, as would take off the Teſtimony of one, that were not a Papiſt, is as good a Witneſs in a Court of Juſtice, as any Proteſtant whatſoever; we are not come here to controvert points of Religions, but to try a bare matter of Fact; ſo that all that ſtuff, that you have heard here this day from the Defendant, and thoſe Inſinuations, that he made about their Religion, on purpoſe to caſt dirt and filth upon all the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, that they have brought againſt him; muſt ſignifie nothing with you at all. If in Caſe ſuch Doctrine happen to prevail, as he has this day preached, then it is in the Power of any Villain, to ſwear any Miſchief whatſoever againſt a Roman Catholick, and that Roman Catholick has no way to vindicate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, nor to make the Truth appear. We have no ſuch Exceptions to Witneſſes in our Law; every man till it is made to appear; that his Credit is forſeited, may and ought to be received, as a Witneſs to give Teſtimony in any Cauſe; ſo that all that matter is of no Import at all.</p>
               <p>And, Gentlemen, I am the rather minded to hint this unto you, becauſe he has inſinuated ſomething out of the Trials of <hi>Grove,</hi> and <hi>Pickering,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> which was in <hi>December,</hi> in the Year 1677 at which Trial, <hi>Whitebread</hi> and <hi>Penwick,</hi> who had pleaded to the ſame Indictment, were brought on to Trial; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there was but one Witneſs againſt them, the Court diſcharged them for that time, and they came not again to Trial, till the Month of <hi>June</hi> or <hi>July</hi> hereafter, when they wereconvicted and executed; now between that time of <hi>Ireland</hi>'s Trial, and the time, when <hi>Whitebread</hi> and the reſt came on to Trial a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, ſays <hi>Oates,</hi> they had ſufficient time to have brought all their Witneſſes from St. <hi>Omers,</hi> to teſtify this buſineſs of my being there, having notice by the former Trial, what Evidence was againſt them; but all the Witneſſes they did bring, which were about fifteen or ſixteen, were not ſufficient to countervan the Teſtimony, that <hi>Oates</hi> gave of his being here in Town, and thereupon they were convicted, condemned, and afterwards (I am ſorry to ſay it) exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted.</p>
               <p>This is the Objection he makes, but at the ſame time I muſt repeat what I ſaid before, when ſuch a diſmal Story as this was told, when he had the Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to relate it before, in the Houſes of Parliament, and there obtained Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit; no wonder, if in that hurry, all of that perſwaſſon were look'd upon with an Evil Eye; and the conviction of thoſe that were at that time accuſed were too eaſie.</p>
               <p>We muſt remember the apprehanſions ſome were under, of our Religion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be ſubverted, our Government to be deſtroyed, our King to be murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, our Throats to be cut by the Papiſts, to that height, that this very Fellow, <hi>Oates,</hi> was ſo much credited, that all other people almoſt were below him, and greater Reſpect ſhown to him, than to the Branches of the Royal Family. Nay it was come to that degree of Folly, to give it no worſe name, that in publick ſocieties, to the Reproach and Infamy of them be it ſpoken, this profligate Villain was ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſed, was drunk to, and ſaluted, by the Name of the <hi>Saviom of the Nation.</hi> O prodigious madneſs! that ſuch a Title, as that was, ſhould ever be given to ſuch a Proſtitute Monſter of Impiety, as this is.</p>
               <p>Good God, whither were we running, when many eaſſe people were ſo ſtrangely wrought upon by this Impoſtor, and when the Viſlainous and black de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of ſome Evil Inſtruments amongſt us, could prevail ſo far, as to deceive al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt a whole Nation into the Belief of ſo horrid a Falſhood; even at the ſame time, that a hidden Treaſon too deeply contriv'd was carryed on amongſt us!
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:102575:46"/>but, God be thanked, was not too lately diſcovered. The Conſpirators had a fair Game of it, whilſt this Fellow was believed, and they needed no other means to accompliſh their Deſign: But when he was found falſe, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Plot, had loſt its Credit in the World, what is their next ſtep? why, then they enter into that Black and Bloudy Conſpiracy, from which it hath pleaſed God lately to deliver us.</p>
               <p>I ſpeak this the rather, becauſe I know there are in my Eye ſeveral perſons, whoſe fears of Popery, made them give Credit to ſuch Villains as theſe before: But when it pleaſed God to open their Eyes, and the falſe miſt vaniſht, they found a Real Conſpiracy, againſt the Perſons of that Bleſſed King, lately dead, and of our Gracious Sovereign, now Living, carried on under the pretence of that falſe, but ſo much credited diſcovery, and now God be thanked all our Eyes are open. And I hope, as we are ſecured from what we ſo vainly dreaded, ſo we ſhall not be afraid to have Villainy detected, and the greateſt mark of Infamy that can be, put upon it.</p>
               <p>Yes, Gentlemen, there was a Conſult, and there was a Conſpiracy againſt the Life of our King, our Goverment, and our Religion: Not a Conſult at the White-Horſe in the <hi>Strand,</hi> but a Cabal and Aſſociation of perfidious Rebels and Traitors, who had a mind to embroil us in Bloud and Confuſion, but, God be thanked, it had not its deſired Effect; the ſame ſort of Villams, were Parties in this Conſpiracy, that had too great a hand in the late great Rebellion, which we to this day feel the ſmart of, and they had a mind to make uſe of the like In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, as they did before, to bring us into the like miſery, as we were before involv'd in.</p>
               <p>And is it not a prodigious thing, to have ſuch actions as theſe to day defended in a Court of Juſtice, with that Impudence and Unconcernedneſs, as tho he would Challenge even God Almighty to puniſh his Wickedneſs, and Blaſphemouſly bleſſes God, that he has liv'd to do ſuch wonderful Service to the Proteſtant Religion; and is ſo obſtinate in his Villainy, as to declare, he would venture his Bloud for the Confirmation of ſo impious a Falſhood: and indeed to ſpeak the Truth, he makes no great venture in it; for when he had pawn'd his immortal Soul, by ſo perjur'd a Teſtimony, he may very eaſily proffer the venturing of his viſe Carcaſs to maintain it.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, having thus ſaid (and I could not forbear ſaying of it) give me leave to put you in mind of what lies before you now to be tryed. Firſt, this Indictment takes notice, that there was an Indictment, taken before the Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer,</hi> and Gaol-delivery at <hi>Hicks</hi>'s Hall, of High Treaſon againſt <hi>Whitebread, Fenwick, Ireland, Pickering</hi> and <hi>Grove,</hi> and that Indictment, and the whole Record is proved to you by <hi>Swift:</hi> For I muſt tell you as I go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, what proofs there are of all the particulars, and you, upon Conſideration of all that is alledged, are to be Judges, what is ſufficient proof to convict the Defendant of the Crime, that is laid to him; which is wilful and corrupt Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury. The Indictment, Gentlemen, ſets forth the Oath, that <hi>Oates</hi> did make at <hi>Ireland</hi>'s Trial, and then averrs it to be falſe: For the Oath that he did take, that ſtands thus, That he did ſwear he was preſent at a Conſult, held at the White-Horſe-Tavern in the <hi>Strand,</hi> the twenty fourth of <hi>April,</hi> 1678: That he did ſwear, That it was there reſolved to murder the late King: How that that Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was carryed by him from Chamber to Chamber, that is, to <hi>Whitebread</hi>'s and <hi>Fenwick,</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi>'s Chambers, and ſaw them ſign this reſolution there; and the Aſſignment of the Perjury, is, That he was not preſent at any Conſult, 'tis not that there was not any ſuch Conſult, though it appears by the Evidence that there was none ſuch, but that he was not preſent at any Conſult at all held there at that time.</p>
               <p>Now, that he did make ſuch an Oath, is proved by a worthy Gentleman, Mr. <hi>Foſter;</hi> a Gentleman known to you all, that live in the City of <hi>London;</hi> and he did truly make that Remark in the beginning of his Teſtimony, that any honeſt man in his place would have done, That he was one of thoſe unfortunate men, that tryed Mr. <hi>Ireland;</hi> for though a man do go according to his Conſcience, as to be ſure there is no queſtion to be made of it, but all theſe Jury men did in finding that Verdict; yet when I come to find, that the Evidence, upon which I convict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thoſe men, is detected to be falſe; and that upon my Verdict the perſons were
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:102575:46"/>executed; tho no Guilt of their Bloud is really contracted by me; yet I cannot but think my ſelf unfortunate, that I was, though innocently, an Inſtrument of their death: and there is never an one of you, but would have thought your ſelves unfortunate, if you had convicted men upon ſuch a Teſtimony, which though you believed then, yet afterwards you ſhould have reaſon to conclude was falſe. And yet <hi>Oates</hi> would have you think, that becauſe they believed him when he was a Villain, and not known to be ſo, you muſt believe him, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his Villainy is now diſcovered; for that is all the Argument this Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Doctor has a mind to impoſe upon you by.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, Mr. <hi>Sollicitor</hi> has been very particular, in giving an Account of the whole Evidence, and then it comes to this, which is the natural queſtion in the Caſe, Whether upon the Teſtimonies, that have been given to you, there does remain ſo much as a doubt, what Verdict you ought to give; for I confeſs, were it a thing in the leaſt doubtful, matters of Perjury are ſo nice and tender, that we and you ought to be Cautious how we convict People for Perjury in doubtful matters; but if it be a thing without doubt, and plainly Evident, that there was a Verdict thereupon, adds to the Guilt; becauſe the Juſtice of the Nation is impoſed upon; the God of Heaven deliver every honeſt man's Soul and Conſcience from ſuch Guilt. For my part, I would not for the Univerſe, have the leaſt Guilt of Innocent Blood lie upon me.</p>
               <p>Then, Gentlemen, to prove what <hi>Oates</hi> ſwore is not true, you have no leſs than twenty two Witneſſes, that ſwear directly he was not here in <hi>London</hi> the twenty fourth of <hi>April,</hi> 1678. But it may be that it is not ſuch a Poſitive Teſtimony as the Law requires to prove a Perjury; but then to ſwear direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that he was in another place at that time, is a poſitive contradiction to his Evidence; and this has been teſtified by the Oaths of twenty two Perſons, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the credit of whoſe Teſtimony there is no Objection at all really made, but only Impudence; and that ſhadow of an Objection, They are all Papiſts, and I am a Proteſtant; and truly a wonderful credit it is, I muſt needs ſay, for the Proteſtant Religion for to have ſuch a Learned and Pious Supporter, as Mr. <hi>Oates,</hi> to be of that perſwaſion; but it is certain there was a <hi>Judas</hi> amongſt the twelve Apoſtles, and there are Raſcals of all perſwaſions. And truly I take it makes never the more for his advantage, nor the Honour of our Church, that he is pleaſed to call himſelf by that name, which he, and ſuch as he, have brought into ſome Scandal and Reproach, by ſetting themſelves up, as the great Pillars of it; but we know Doctor <hi>Oates</hi> has been very Liberal to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he has given himſelf Baptiſm, and given himſelf the Doctor's Degree, and now he gives himſelf the Title of the Reforming Proteſtant, Mr. <hi>Oates.</hi> We have Proteſtant Shooe-makers, and Proteſtant Joyners, and Proteſtant A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſts, and all ſorts of true Proteſtant Raſcals; but it becomes us and you to aſſert the Honour of our Religion by diſowning any Fellowſhip with ſuch Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains, or their Actions.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, the Method that was taken, gives you an exact account in point of time, as to this whole Buſineſs. Firſt, ſays Mr. <hi>Hilſley,</hi> I left him, in time the twenty third of <hi>April,</hi> New Stile, at St. <hi>Omers,</hi> and I am ſure I ſaw him there then, which is the thirteenth, Old Stile; the twenty fourth of <hi>April,</hi> New Stile, which is the fourteenth, Old Stile, I came from St. <hi>Omers,</hi> I did not ſee him there that morning, but I my ſelf came to <hi>Callis,</hi> it being Sunday; and I ſtayed there till Sunday in the Afternoon, and all night. I came on Munday in the Afternoon to take water at <hi>Callis,</hi> and from thence went to <hi>Dover.</hi> And from thence the next day I went towards <hi>London;</hi> but I ſtayed four or five days by the way before I came to <hi>London;</hi> but then there is this Circumſtance that you muſt take along with you, Gentlemen, That at this time, one Mr. <hi>Bournaby</hi> was coming from <hi>London,</hi> and going to St. <hi>Omers,</hi> and met with Mr. <hi>Hilſley</hi> in his way towards <hi>London;</hi> ſays <hi>Hilſley,</hi> I came afterwards to Town, and that was upon the Munday following, which happens to be the twenty firſt or twenty ſecond of <hi>April,</hi> Our Stile; but this I do remember very par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:102575:47"/>ticularly, which makes his Teſtimony to be true, and not dreſſed up for this occaſion, ſays he, I told one <hi>Osborn</hi> at that time that we had a pretty fellow at St. <hi>Omers,</hi> that went ſometimes by the name of <hi>Lucy,</hi> and ſometimes by the name of <hi>Oates,</hi> a Miniſter of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> and there he comes and gives an account of his ridiculous childiſh Actions, and what a remarkable Fellow he was; and this, ſays he, I told to <hi>Osborn.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now to make this good, you have one Mr. <hi>Dorrel,</hi> who tells you there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened a Diſcourſe, where he was preſent, between his Mother and Mr. <hi>Osborn,</hi> about Religion; and amongſt other things, <hi>Osborn</hi> did ſay, Mr. <hi>Hilſley</hi> had told him he left <hi>Oates</hi> at St. <hi>Omers</hi> when he came away from thence; and Mr. <hi>Osborn,</hi> he comes and ſays, I remember I did tell Mr. <hi>Dorrel</hi> and his Mother, at that time that Mr. <hi>Hilſley</hi> did tell me this Story: ſo that here are theſe two Witneſſes which ſupport Mr. <hi>Hilſley</hi> in that Circumſtance of the time of his coming away, and his Relation of <hi>Oates</hi> being left behind him, and that this was related about the twenty firſt or twenty ſecond of <hi>April.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bournaby</hi> is the next Perſon that was produced, and he ſwears he met <hi>Hilſley</hi> by <hi>Cittinbourn;</hi> and he happens to ſet out for St. <hi>Omers</hi> the eighteenth of <hi>April,</hi> Our Stile, and to come thither to St. <hi>Omers</hi> the twenty firſt; and he ſwears poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively that he was there the twenty firſt, twenty ſecond, twenty third, and was there the twenty fifth day of <hi>April,</hi> Our Stile; and he does poſitively affirm, that all thoſe days he ſaw <hi>Oates</hi> there at St. <hi>Omers;</hi> that <hi>Oates</hi> intruded into his company at his firſt coming; and that he and all the other Scholars wondred at the confidence of the man; and he particularly remembers that he was with him at a Publick Entertainment that was there the twenty fifth; and if ſo, then it is impoſſible that what <hi>Oates</hi> has ſworn of his being at the Conſult the twenty fourth of <hi>April,</hi> Our Stile, can be true; and except you can imagine Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> to fly from St. <hi>Omers</hi> the twenty fourth day in the morning, and he at the Conſult and back again at night, which is more than he would have believed, becauſe he ſwears the contrary, you muſt conclude that what he ſwore was falſe.</p>
               <p>The next Witneſs is Mr. <hi>Pool,</hi> and he comes and ſays, he was there at St. <hi>Omers,</hi> and he came over from thence the twenty fifth of <hi>April,</hi> and that was the day after <hi>Oates</hi> ſwears the Conſult of the Plot to be here; and all the reſt of the Witneſſes do directly ſwear, That at the time that <hi>Pool</hi> went from thence, <hi>Oates</hi> was there; ſo that the Teſtimony of <hi>Pool</hi> is fully and poſitively confirmed; and <hi>Pool</hi> gives you a reaſon, why he came over, which was the death of a Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his, and upon a Proſpect of an Eſtate he came into <hi>England,</hi> which likewiſe is a reaſonable Circumſtance why he ſhould remember the time, becauſe he had ſuch Inducement to come over hither.</p>
               <p>The next, Gentlemen, is one <hi>Thornton,</hi> and he comes to the Month of <hi>May,</hi> to the firſt and ſecond of <hi>May,</hi> Their Stile, which was the twenty firſt and twenty ſecond of <hi>April.</hi> Our Stile, and particularly he is ſure <hi>Oates</hi> was there upon the twenty ſecond of <hi>April,</hi> Our Stile, that is the ſecond of <hi>May,</hi> Their Stile. For ſays he, there was an Action or a Play of the Scholars; and I can tell you how I remember <hi>Oates</hi> was there, <hi>Oates</hi> had a mind to have a place to ſee the Play, which he had no pretence or title to; and he had a ſcufftle with ſome body about it; and therefore I remember by that token, that he was there at that time.</p>
               <p>Now, Gentlemen, it is not eaſie to be imagined, that ſix or ſeven men ſhould agree in their Teſtimony in all thoſe Circumſtances, which in themſelves are but minute; yet when offered as Reaſons to induce mens Remembrance, muſt be allowed as good Reaſons; and yet this to be thought to be but a made Story. If Sir <hi>Richard Barker</hi>'s Coach-man, and Mrs. <hi>Mayo</hi> had had any ſuch Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances to ſupport their Teſtimony, they would have had much more Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit.</p>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:102575:47"/>
               <p>Then there is one <hi>Conway;</hi> and it is very obſervable what he ſpeaks of: for he was there all the while that they ſay <hi>Oates</hi> was there, and he gives you an account that he ſaw him with <hi>Bournaby</hi> the firſt time he came over, and agrees with <hi>Bournaby</hi> in this, that he wondred much at his confidence, and did think that he was very well known to him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: He ſwears <hi>Oates</hi> came in thither about the beginning of <hi>December</hi> 77, and he was not abſent, ſays he and ſeveral more, any one night, except in <hi>January</hi> once at <hi>Watton,</hi> till he went away in <hi>June</hi> 78. Nay, they are ſo preciſe in their memory for very good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, becauſe they are ſo regular in their Societies, and keep a ſtrict Order, each has his fixed place in the Refactory, where all the <hi>Socii</hi> or the Members of the Colledge do meet; and becauſe this Fellow was an old Fellow, older than the reſt, and likewiſe was a Dunce, therefore he was ſet at the Dunce-Table in every bodies view, becauſe he was a Blockhead, and too old to keep company with the Boys; ſo that though perhaps one of thoſe young Follows in a mixt Society may eſcape the view, and be abſent without being miſs'd, yet Remarkable Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> is not ſo eaſily forgotten, that us'd to ſit by himſelf. And as that Noble Lord my Lord <hi>Gerrard</hi> of <hi>Bromeley</hi> ſays, he has a particular Face, and a particular Tone; and there was more reaſon to remark him than any other, both upon the account of his Perſon and of his Actions; ſo that I muſt needs ſay indeed, it is not a down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right and poſitive ſwearing, but their Teſtimony is given with deliberation and recollecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſuch particular Circumſtances as may reaſonably induce any unprejudic'd perſon to give credit to it.</p>
               <p>The next Witneſs, Gentlemen, is <hi>Haggerſton,</hi> whoſe Evidence is wonderful particular, and very material, as to the Circumſtances that accompany it. For you are to obſerve, that in theſe Colledges ſome are of the Sodality, and ſome are not; and ſome are of ſuch and ſuch Claſſes or Forms, and others of other. Now this Gentleman and Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> were of the ſame Form, and he does particularly remember that he was ſetting up for a Preacher, as he has an excellent knack that way; and he tells you how ridiculous he made the late King in a Sermon; that he halted between two Opinions, and there ran a ſtream of Popery between his legs; and ſuch-like precious ſtuff he vented. And to fix it to be about the ſame time that is now in queſtion, he ſays, he particularly remembers it was when he was Reader, when Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> was, it ſeems, the Buffoon to the Society, or as I may call him, the Jack-pudding to the Colledge, that us'd to make them ſport, and was guilty of ſo many ridiculous things, that they could not but put particular Remarks upon him.</p>
               <p>Next, I take notice that this perſon ſays, there were two perſons, <hi>Williams</hi> and <hi>Marſh,</hi> that were qualified to give Suffrages in the Congregation, that is, they were paſs'd eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years ſtanding, and did go over: For that there was a Conſult, is not denied, nor that it was in <hi>London,</hi> nor that it was upon the 24th of <hi>April;</hi> but they ſay, it was a Triennial Meeting, which they us'd to have once in three years for the choice of ſome Officers to manage the Affairs of the Society; as for the choice of a Provincial, and other perſons that they were to ſend upon their Errands, in order to the ſupport of their Society; ſo that under the colour and countenance of what was in it ſelf ordinary and uſual, and that happened to be at that time, <hi>Oates,</hi> who had heard ſomewhat of it, and that it was the 24th of <hi>April,</hi> and that ſuch and ſuch were to be there, he upon that Hearſay, as ſhould ſeem at St. <hi>Omers,</hi> does feign and contrive this pretended Conſpiracy.</p>
               <p>The next is one <hi>Beeſton;</hi> and it is very material too that he ſwears: For beſides what he teſtifies, that from the time of his coming, which was in <hi>December</hi> 77, he was not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent till the 23th of <hi>June,</hi> when he went away; and for the time in queſtion, he very well remembers his being there, by this Circumſtance: ſays he, I was choſen to be Reader of the Sodality in the month of <hi>March,</hi> but then <hi>Oates</hi> comes and gets the Office out of my hands; but ſtill with me there was that benefit reſerv'd, that if he ſhould at any time fail of Reading there upon a Sunday, or a Foly-day, I was then to have read, and to have ſupplied his place. Says he, I was there from <hi>March</hi> till the time <hi>Oates</hi> went away in <hi>June;</hi> and <hi>Oates</hi> read there that very Sunday before the time in <hi>June</hi> that he went away. And I am ſure I heard him read every time; and in cafe he had not read every time, I muſt have read in his abſence: but I did not read at all, during that time.</p>
               <p>Now, Gentlemen, when a man is to ſucceed or to ſupply the abſence of another in an Office that is peculiar as to the Charge incumbent upon the Officer, and confiderable as to the profit of it, that muſt needs make an impreſſion upon the mind, and give a man a more exact remembrance of the thing, and therefore I reeommend it particularly to your obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:102575:48"/>
               <p>The next is one Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> and he ſays he ſaw <hi>Oates</hi> there all the time: And as to one part of it, when he himſelf was in the Infirmary, <hi>Oates</hi> went to viſit him every two or three days; nay, and about ſuch a time in <hi>May,</hi> ſays he, which was about the beginning of <hi>May, Oates</hi> being then in the Infirmary not well, the Doctor and he had a pretty Dialogue together, and <hi>Oates</hi> ſpoke falſe Latine to the Doctor, for he ſaid, <hi>Si placeat Dominatio ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtra,</hi> in the beginning of his Complement; this he did particularly ſay was the expreſſion that this excellent Schollar uſed to the Phyſician at his firſt application to him, and all the whole Colledge took notice of that piece of his Learning.</p>
               <p>The next is one <hi>Price,</hi> and he tells you, he was there all the time that the others ſpeak of; he remembers him very well, and particularly ſays, I am ſure <hi>Oates</hi> was there the 11th of <hi>May N. S.</hi> which will be the firſt of <hi>May O. S.</hi> Becauſe, ſays he, I know he was ſoundly bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten that day upon a quarrel that he had there; this particularly he ſpeaks to, beſides his remembrance of the other Circumſtances in concurrence with the former Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Doddington</hi> ſwears the ſame, and Mr. <hi>Gerrard</hi> alſo ſwears the ſame, with that other particular circumſtance that Mr. Sollicitor repeated to you, which was of <hi>Oates</hi> being there upon the day of Confirmation the 26th of <hi>May N. S.</hi> the 16th of <hi>May O. S.</hi> and he is ſure of it, becauſe he was confirmed along with him, and therefore it is impoſſible he ſhould for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get it: And my Lord <hi>Gerrard,</hi> who was the next, gives this reaſon upon his remembrance of all the forementioned particulars, that he always took ſpecial notice of the man for his Canting Tone, his Phyſiognomy, and remarkable Behaviour.</p>
               <p>Then there is Mr. <hi>Morgan</hi> who is no Papiſt, but a Miniſter of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> now Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> was angry with all the reſt, becauſe they were Catholicks; but what has he to ſay to Mr. <hi>Morgan</hi> who is a Proteſtant? Why the truth is, there are none of them to be believed, becauſe they ſwear againſt him, and really he ought to be permitted to give that reaſon, or it is like to go very hard with him; for if in caſe you believe but a third part of the Teſtimony that has been given, it is enough to do his work. But what ſays Mr. <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan?</hi> truly he comes up to the 24th of <hi>April</hi> particularly, and he tells you how he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members it; and the firſt occaſion he had to look into it was, they being all ſurprized at St. <hi>Omers</hi> at what <hi>Oates</hi> had Sworn, and Mr. <hi>Morgan</hi> recollecting with himſelf, did remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that that very day he was playing at Ball within the Colledge, and happened to toſs his Ball over the Wall into the Garden, and not being able to recover it any other way, he ſpyed <hi>Oates</hi> walking and looking into his Book, and therefore he deſired him to lend him his Key, and by the help of that, he went in and fetched his Ball; and this was the very day that <hi>Oates</hi> ſwore he was here.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Arrundel</hi> ſays the ſame: the two <hi>Turberviles</hi> ſay the ſame; and one of them is po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive to have ſeen him there either the 24th and 25th, or 23d and 24th of <hi>April O. S.</hi> which is the 3d and 4th, or 4th and 5th of <hi>May N. S.</hi> and if it were either of theſe days, it cannot be poſſible he ſhould be here at the Conſult.</p>
               <p>The next is Mr. <hi>Clavering,</hi> and I cannot but particularly take notice of what he has ſworn: he ſays Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> was there all the time that the reſt ſpeak of; but it ſeems parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly about the time of the Congregation in <hi>London:</hi> there comes in a Stranger that was poor, and this Gentleman Mr. <hi>Clavering</hi> made a Collection for him; and it was talked of in the Colledge as the reaſon why he had not ſucceſs in his Collection, becauſe the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were gone to the Congregation. Nay, and yet farther ſays he, I do remember particularly that Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> and Mr. <hi>Marſh</hi> did go over to the Congregation, but <hi>Oates</hi> did not, for I do remember when <hi>Williams</hi> and <hi>Marſh</hi> came back again, I had ſome diſcourſe with Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> about the Congregation: He came to me and deſired to know of me what account I was able to give of the matter of that Meeting after the Conſult was over. Now had Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> been there and been a perſon of that great Truſt that he had ſworn himſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, he needed not ſure have asked Mr. <hi>Clavering</hi> at St. <hi>Omers</hi> what the buſineſs of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult was at <hi>London,</hi> where he himſelf had been, but the other had not.</p>
               <p>There is beſides Mr. <hi>Capley,</hi> another Witneſs, Mr. <hi>Cooke,</hi> that ſpeaks particularly of the 30th of <hi>April,</hi> that he was ſure <hi>Oates</hi> was there then, becauſe of the Proceſſion, and becauſe he walked by himſelf in it; and <hi>Wright</hi> the laſt Witneſs gives a general account, but ſpeaks to no particular time.</p>
               <p>And now, Gentlemen, after all this Evidenc, <hi>Viva voce,</hi> you muſt give me leave to hint <hi>Teſtimonium Rei,</hi> an improbable Oath was that which <hi>Oates</hi> owns he made, if it be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in all its parts. Can any man believe that fifty perſons ſhould meet together in a Tavern in <hi>London,</hi> and theſe fifty perſons ſhould come to a Reſolution to kill the King and
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:102575:48"/>ſubvert the Government, and alter the Religion; and that this Conſultation being drawn up in the Tavern (for ſo he ſwears it was) they ſhould ſever themſelves into leſſer Clubbs and Companies, and take care that none ſhould ſign when they were altogether and among themſelves, but muſt have it carryed up and down from one mans Chamber to another and find no body to truſt with this Affair, that if diſcovered, muſt ſubject them to preſent deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and ruine their whole party, but onely Mr. <hi>Oates,</hi> who was none of their own Order, nor does appear to be of ſuch Credit amongſt them? Can you believe any men ſhould be ſo void of ſenſe and reaſon, that of fifty together, and thoſe reputed as ſubtile as any ſort of men whatſoever, there ſhould not be one man of common underſtanding that ſhould take care for a more rational Management of ſo great and hazardous an Undertaking? when they were met together, and might have diſpatcht it in a quarter of an hour, they ſhould ſeparate themſelves into ſeveral parts of the Town, and truſt a Reſolution of that nature in Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> pocket, in whom if they had had more Confidence than they ſeem to have, yet it was folly and madneſs to give him that opportunity of deſtroying all them, and making himſelf; were there no other Evidence but the very Teſtimony of the thing, it would go a very great way with me I confeſs; but I muſt ſay withal, you are Judges of this Fact upon a ſuperadded Teſtimony of Twenty two Witneſſes <hi>Viva voce,</hi> I think it leaves the thing without any doubt.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, the Anſwer given by the Defendant to this Charge is very fallacious; and though he puts ſuch a Countenance upon it, as though his Witneſſes were ſuch perſons of Credit, that nothing could be objected againſt them yet he is certainly very much miſtaken in that: He has produced but two potitive Witneſſes, and thoſe two as poſitive as they are in their proof, are likewiſe poſitive in their Contradictions of one another, and what they have ſaid is left to your Conſideration.</p>
               <p>The one is a Coachman, the other was Sir <hi>Richard Barker</hi>'s Houſe-keeper; they indeed do ſay Sir <hi>Richard Barker</hi>'s Wifes Siſter, and his Nephew, and his Daughter, and his Neeces, and a worſhipful Knight, and I know not who, that the old Woman tells me are gone into my Countrey, were all there at the ſame time, and no body comes to teſtifie it, but onely this Coachman and this old Woman: Theſe, Gentlemen, are things fit to be thought of.</p>
               <p>But now let us conſider how they agree in their Evidence. Says the Woman, I ſaw him not till the beginning of <hi>May,</hi> but I am ſure he was there before once or twice. And how does ſhe know that? becauſe the Coachman told her ſo, and he came there ſeveral times, but he did Dine there but once; and when he came there the firſt time ſhe ſaw him, he came in ſuch a diſguiſe, and he had a ſhort Perriwig, and a kind of ſhort white Coat, and a white Hat; but when my Coachman comes to ſwear, he tells you the firſt time he ſaw him, the Woman ſaw him too, that he had his own Hair, and cut cloſe to his cars, that made him look, as the young fellow told her, like a Quaker. And when I asked the Coachman, Are you ſure that <hi>Benjamin</hi> the young Fellow did ſee him the firſt time you ſaw him there? he told me, No; but he was ſure the old Woman did look out of the window and ſee him, which ſhe denies. I then asked him how often he dined there? he tells you ſeveral times, and there were ſuch and ſuch, and the old Woman did ſee him dine there ſeveral times; which ſhe denies that ſhe ever ſaw him dine there above once: And I take notice of one of the Evidence, the Coachman, he gives but an odd ſort of reaſon for his remembrance: In <hi>February</hi> ſays he, my Lady died, and my Maſter was ſick at <hi>Putney,</hi> and <hi>Oates</hi> came into the Yard while I was cleaning my Coach; and I am ſure it was where the Coat of Arms hung over the door becauſe he asked me about my Ladies death, and therefore it muſt be in <hi>May,</hi> when, for ought does appear to the contrary, it might be in any other Month af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Eſcutcheon was up; and in the other circumſtances there is no certainty at all: So that it is plain, theſe Witneſſes ſwear according as their humour leads them, and not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to any remembrance they have of the thing.</p>
               <p>And I rather believe it, becauſe the third Witneſs, that is <hi>Page</hi> the Apothecary, that uſed to make up Sir <hi>Richard Barker</hi>'s Medicines, gives an Evidence contrary to both thoſe, he cannot remember the year poſitively or particularly; but I'll tell you how he thwarts and contradicts the other peoples Teſtimony; for he remembers he came in ſuch a diſguife, but he believes no body ſpoke to him but himſelf, becauſe he found him walking in the place that was for the common reception of the Patients, and he asked for Dr. <hi>Tongue,</hi> and he not being within, he went away very diſcontented: and ſo now theſe three Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes ſeem to contradict one another; and the laſt Witneſs <hi>Walker,</hi> who is the Parſon, he ſays nothing to the matter; for it does plainly appear the time which he ſpeaks of, which
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:102575:49"/>was about a year and a half before he was call'd to teſtifie at the five Jeſuits Tryal, muſt be in the year 77, and not in the year 78, which is the Queſtion here, which muſt be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he went firſt to St. <hi>Omers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Gentlemen, the other part of Mr. <hi>Oates</hi>'s Defence has been upon this Topick: ſays he, I have been believed heretofore, the Parliaments have given me credit; and to prove it, he has call'd ſeveral Noble Lords and Perſons of Quality. The firſt was my Lord of <hi>Devon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> who ſays he cannot remember any particulars of his Evidence, 'tis ſo long ſince; but he remembers the Parliament, upon the Evidence given of the Plot, did make ſuch Votes as we do all know of. And there were a great many people that gave credit to his Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, who, God be thanked, are of another opinion now. And my Lord of <hi>Clare</hi> ſays, he was not in the Houſe of Lords at the beginning of the Diſcovery, and cannot remember any thing in particular. But my Lord of <hi>Huntingdon</hi> was a little more particular; and Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> began to be angry with him, becauſe he ſpoke ſo much: ſays he, I remember Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> was examin'd in the Houſe of Lords, and was believed there, becauſe they did believe he ſpoke truth at that time; but now upon conſideration of the Contradictions and Falſities of his Evidence, I cannot but ſay, I do believe him, ſays he, to be a great Villain, and that he has been guilty of ſpilling innocent Bloud. And this Noble Lord ſpeaks with great Honour and Conſideration: And truly I believe, if every man that is here were to ſpeak his mind, my Lord has delivered the Opinions of us all, and many thouſands more in the Nation.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> call'd next my Lord Chief Baron, my Brother <hi>Gregory,</hi> my Lord of <hi>London,</hi> Sir <hi>George Treby,</hi> Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> and my Brother <hi>Dolben.</hi> But they all tell you, they are able to give no particular Anſwers to his Queſtions; and this was the ſum of his Evidence.</p>
               <p>To this Mr. Attorney General has given a Reply of Evidence that truly is of very great moment. Firſt, here is produced Sir <hi>George Wakeman,</hi> whom <hi>Oates</hi> accuſed of High-Treaſon, and he ſuffered his Tryal and was acquitted; ſo that as well as the Jury had given credit to him in the former Verdicts, ſo ſays Mr. Attorney, I muſt ſpeak likewiſe for the credit of that Verdict that did disbelieve him, becauſe though he did ſwear as roundly and briskly up to the matter as he had done before, yet when he had not the hurry and ſurprize of his Diſcovery to ſupport him, his Villany was detected, and the Innocent ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted. And beſides the Record of the acquittal, here is the Perſon himſelf, who is now under no dread or danger, having ſtood his Tryal and being acquitted; and he takes it upon his Oath, in the preſence of the Great God the Searcher of Hearts, That whatſoever <hi>Oates</hi> ſwore againſt him at his Tryal, was every tittle of it falſe: And this Acquittal of his, being after great and mature conſideration, is an Evidence of anothergets quality than the Verdicts of the other Convictions.</p>
               <p>Next to him, is my Lord <hi>Caſtlemain,</hi> a Perſon of very great Honour; and he gives an account he was arraigned of High-Treaſon at this Bar, and upon his Tryal <hi>Oates</hi> was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced as a Witneſs againſt him, and there he ſwore he met with my Lord <hi>Caſtlemain</hi> in <hi>Lincolns-Inn-Fields,</hi> and great familiarity there was between them, ſo that my Lord could not truſt him in a leſs affair than the Plot; and away he goes with him to <hi>Fenwick</hi>'s Chamber, there to talk about a Deſigne of killing the late King. Mr. <hi>Oates,</hi> of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, muſt be the great Repoſitory of this Secret; but the Jury then being Perſons of great Underſtanding and Integrity, did not believe <hi>Oates,</hi> but acquitted my Lord <hi>Caſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main:</hi> And he does here take it upon his Oath, backt with all the Imprecations of Evil to himſelf that a man can uſe, That there was not one word of truth in <hi>Oates</hi>'s Teſtimony; nor did he ever ſee <hi>Oates</hi> in his life, till ſuch time as he was taken up upon his Accuſation. Now are here two perſons of Honour and Quality, that upon their Oaths do particularly give you an account, as in the preſence of Almighty God, that <hi>Oates</hi> has twice forſworn himſelf againſt them.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, there is notice to be taken of the Journal of the Houſe of Lords; and though it is true for the ſake of the Precedent, and to ſecure the Juſtice of the Nation, we did keep them ſtrictly to their proof, that it was upon Oath. And as to the buſineſs of <hi>Smith,</hi> though we do believe the thing in our private judgments, yet we thought it not fit to be permitted that perſons ſhould upon their own Oathes confeſs themſelves to be guilty of Perjury, and afterwards give Evidence againſt others; for ſuch are not to have the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of ever being Witneſſes again: yet by the Records of Parliament, and other Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, there is enough to make the matter aimed at clear.</p>
               <p>For it is clear by his Narrative, that <hi>Oates</hi> did firſt ſwear, as far as he could well ſwear, to bring him into the diſpleaſure of the People: for that was his way to intimidate all he
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:102575:49"/>had to do with, and thereby force them to comply with his Deſignes. And there was no more plauſible Accuſation at that time, than to accuſe a man for ſaying ſomewhat againſt the Parliament, or being in a Combination to ſubvert the Proteſtant Religion. But you ſee when he comes to have his own turn ſerv'd, then this man upon whom he had fixed ſuch an odious Character, is really no Papiſt at all, but engag'd in ſervice for his King and Country, and has Mr. <hi>Oates</hi>'s Paſſport, a thing of great advantage to him at that ſeaſon. This the Kings Council make uſe of with great reaſon, as an Evidence of Tampering: for the man has altered his opinion of one he had before accuſed, and now brings him as an honeſt to give Evidence for him. And this, ſay they, muſt be intended to be done by Practice and by Threats.</p>
               <p>And the rather, Gentlemen, for that you have an account by Witneſſes ſworn, that there was one <hi>Clay</hi> a Popiſh Prieſt that lay in Priſon at the <hi>Gatebouſe,</hi> and while he was there, <hi>Oates</hi> and Sn <hi>William Waller</hi> came into the Priſon to him, and tampering with him, ſays <hi>Oates,</hi> I hear there are ſome St. <hi>Omers</hi> Boys that intend to teſtifie that I was at St. <hi>Omers,</hi> when I ſay I was at <hi>London;</hi> but you muſt ſwear, that you din'd with me at Mr. <hi>Howards</hi> in <hi>May</hi> 1678: or if you will not, you know I know you to be a Prieſt, and I'll hang you. Says <hi>Clay,</hi> Where is my Silver and Gold that was taken away from me? And we all know Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> was wonderful good at the fingering of Gold; he us'd to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way broad Pieces as Popiſh Reliques, becauſe of the Croſſes upon them. Says <hi>Clay,</hi> Give me my Gold again, I will ſwear for you; I have been a Rogue before, and I may be a Rogue again. And accordingly a Contract is made for him to ſwear directly that <hi>Oates</hi> and he were together at Mr. <hi>Howard</hi>'s houſe in <hi>May</hi> 78. This very Fellow that tells you now the ſtory, told it the next morning to another man, who has likewiſe ſworn the ſame. Then is <hi>Clay</hi> conveyed by <hi>Oates</hi> to the <hi>Old-Baily,</hi> and there ſwears, being thus threatned and ſuborn'd, That in <hi>May</hi> 1678 he and Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> dined together at Mr. <hi>Howard</hi>'s houſe, and you have Mr. <hi>Howard</hi> produc'd, who does ſwear that <hi>Glay</hi> did ſwear ſo; but indeed he was not there with Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> at dinner till <hi>July</hi> after.</p>
               <p>This, Gentlemen, is direct Corruption and Subornation; and if a man will be a corrupt Knave, and endeavour to ſuborn Witneſſes to ſwear that which is falſe, he is the more likely to ſwear falſe himſelf. Beſides, that you are to take notice, here is his own Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive produced, where you have it ſworn by himſelf, That he went back to St. <hi>Omers</hi> about the beginning of <hi>May,</hi> and was there all the month of <hi>May,</hi> and in <hi>June</hi> till the latter end of it. Then all this while either Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> or, his Witneſſes, are perjur'd in the Caſe: He ſays, he ſtay'd but three or four days in <hi>England</hi> after the Conſult was over, and then went ſtreight back again to St. <hi>Omers.</hi> Which muſt be the firſt week in <hi>May;</hi> but if you believe his two Witneſſes, he din'd with them ſeveral times after that: and ſo it is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, ſome of them are guilty of groſs and foul Perjury.</p>
               <p>Now, Centlemen, I cannot but reſort back to the Objection that I made at firſt. 'Tis ſtrange to me, that a man that came upon ſuch a deſigne, ſhould go publickly about the ſtreets at noon-day, though in a diſguiſe, yet he was known. But if you take the perſons time to be in the year 1677, then it is eaſily reconciled what they did ſay of their ſeeing him in ſuch a diſguiſe; and ſo all their Teſtimony may ſtand together, and perhaps they may miſtake in a point of time, though not in the ſubſtance of their Evidence; and I would out of charity conclude it to be ſo.</p>
               <p>But I will ſay, if they are to be taken ſtrictly to the year 1678, it is monſtrous to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that we ſhould have no body brought to let us know where he lodged, where he eat, with whom he convers'd for all that time.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I have detained you the longer in this matter, becauſe I take it to be of ſo great weight, wherein the Juſtice and Honour of the Nation are ſo much engaged, and it was therefore fit this Cauſe ſhould be tryed in the moſt ſolemn and publick manner, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to vindicate the Nation from the Reproach and Calumny of Injuſtice and Oppreſſion. And ſure I am, if you think theſe Witneſſes ſwear true, as I cannot ſee any colour of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, there does not remain the leaſt doubt but that <hi>Oates</hi> is the blackeſt, moſt perjur'd Villain that ever appeared upon the face of the Earth.</p>

               <p>Gentlemen, that we are not, God be thanked, in thoſe times of Diſorder and Confuſion that we have been heretofore in, to have Humming or Hiſſings to declare the Auditors Approbation or Diſlike of Juries Verdicts. But becauſe there has been this day mention made of the Opinions of Judges about Verdicts, I ſhall take the liberty to declare my mind to you now, That formy part, I am ſatisfied in my Conſcience, you have given a good and a juſt Verdict; and ſo I believe is every other Judge upon the Bench.</p>
